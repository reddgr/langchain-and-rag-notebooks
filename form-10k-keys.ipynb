      "company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n",
      "Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\n",

      "Acquisition of ESI Group SA - Valuation of Developed Technology and Customer Relationships\n",

      "million, net of cash acquired, using existing cash. During January 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of the remaining share capital of ESI Group\n",
      "for $458 million, using existing cash. Of the acquired other intangible assets, $270 million of developed technology and $160 million of customer relationships\n",
      "were recorded. The intangible assets were valued by management using different income approach methods, which included the multi-period excess earnings\n",
      "and with and without valuation methods for developed technology and customer relationships, respectively. The significant assumptions used to estimate the\n",

      "rate and total operating expenses.\n",
      "The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of developed technology and customer relationships\n",
      "acquired in the acquisition of ESI Group is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the\n",
      "developed technology and customer relationships acquired; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and\n",
      "evaluating management’s significant assumption related to earnings before interest and taxes; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with\n",
      "specialized skill and knowledge.\n",
      "Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated\n",

      "purchase agreement; (ii) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of the developed technology and customer relationships acquired;\n",
      "(iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings and with and without valuation methods used by management; (iv) testing the\n",
      "completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the multi-period excess earnings and with and without valuation methods; and (v) evaluating the\n",
      "reasonableness of the significant assumption used by management related to earnings before interest and taxes. Evaluating management's assumption related to\n",
      "earnings before interest and taxes involved considering (i) the current and past performance of ESI Group; (ii) the consistency with external market and\n",
      "industry data; and (iii) whether the assumption was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and\n",

      "1.    OVERVIEW, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n",
      "Overview. Keysight Technologies, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “Keysight” or the “company”), incorporated in Delaware on December 6, 2013, is a global innovator\n",
      "in the computing, communications and electronics market, committed to advancing our customers’ business success by helping them solve critical challenges\n",
      "in the development and commercialization of their products and services. Our mission, “accelerating innovation to connect and secure the world,” speaks to\n",
      "the value we provide our customers in a world of ever-increasing technological complexity. We deliver this value through a broad range of design and test\n",
      "solutions that address the critical challenges our customers face in bringing their innovations to market on ever-shorter schedules.\n",
      "Basis of Presentation. We have prepared the accompanying financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\n",
      "Commission (“SEC”) and in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”). Our fiscal year end is October 31. Unless\n",
      "otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to our fiscal year.\n",
      "Management is responsible for the fair presentation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with GAAP, and has\n",
      "full responsibility for their integrity and accuracy. In the opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements contain all normal and\n",
      "recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly our consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of operations, consolidated statement of\n",
      "comprehensive income, consolidated statement of cash flows and consolidated statement of equity.\n",
      "Principles of consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries.\n",
      "All significant inter-company transactions have been eliminated. The consolidated financial statements also reflect the impact of non-controlling interests. Non-\n",
      "controlling interests do not have a significant impact on the consolidated results of operations; therefore, net income attributable to non-controlling interests for\n",
      "the year ended October 31, 2024 of $4 million is not presented separately and is included in “other income (expense), net” in the consolidated statements of\n",
      "operations.\n",
      "Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\n",
      "the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various\n",
      "other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the\n",
      "company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. We are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update\n",
      "to our estimates or judgments or a revision of the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of October 31, 2024. Our critical accounting policies are those that\n",
      "affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition,\n",
      "inventory valuation, share-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, business combinations, valuation of goodwill and other\n",
      "intangible assets, warranty, loss contingencies, restructuring and accounting for income taxes.\n",
      "Revenue recognition. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the\n",
      "consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We primarily generate revenue from the sale of products (hardware and/or\n",
      "software), services, or a combination thereof. We enter into contracts that may involve multiple performance obligations, and we allocate the transaction price\n",
      "between each performance obligation on the basis of relative standalone selling price (“SSP”). Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any\n",
      "taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\n",
      "61\n",
      "Table of Contents\n",
      "Product revenues are generated predominantly from the sale of various types of design and test software and hardware. Products consist of standalone\n",
      "software and hardware generally installed with software applications that are licensed on a perpetual and term basis. Our hardware products generally do not\n",
      "have any substantive acceptance terms that would otherwise preclude the transfer of control. Performance obligations related to our software licenses, including\n",
      "the license portion of our software subscriptions, grant the customer the right to use our software primarily via electronic delivery.\n",
      "Service revenues consist of repair and calibration services, extended warranties, technical support for hardware and software, when-and-if available\n",
      "software updates and upgrades, and professional services, including installation and implementation, consulting, and training. Services include both hardware\n",
      "and software services. Repair and calibration services for hardware products are sold both as per-incident customer services and as customer agreements to\n",
      "provide such services over the contractual period. Extended warranties are optional to the customer and provide warranty on hardware products for additional\n",
      "years beyond the standard one-year warranty. Technical support for software and when-and-if available software updates and upgrades are sold either together\n",
      "with our software licenses and software subscriptions, or separately as part of our customer support programs. These are considered stand-ready performance\n",
      "obligations where customers benefit from the services evenly throughout the license or service period. Our professional services may be sold on a time and\n",
      "material basis (e.g., consulting) or on a fixed-fee basis (e.g., non-recurring engineering).\n",
      "We also generate revenues from a combination of products and services (“custom solutions”), including combinations of hardware, software, software\n",
      "subscriptions, installation, professional services, and other support services. Custom solutions provide the customer with a combination of hardware, software\n",
      "and professional services to meet customers' unique specifications and are accounted for as one performance obligation.\n",
      "For our contracts with customers, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. Our standard payment terms are net 30\n",
      "to 90 days, and we generally do not offer extended payment terms beyond one year. Our contracts typically contain various forms of variable consideration,\n",
      "including trade discounts, trade-in credits, rebates, and rights of return. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations based on\n",
      "relative SSP. SSPs for a majority of our products and services are estimated based on our established pricing practices and maximize the use of observable\n",
      "inputs. An observable input is the price of the good or service when it is sold as a separate item in a similar circumstance and to a similar customer as in the\n",
      "contract for which SSPs are being determined. We have elected to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental\n",
      "authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected by Keysight from a customer (e.g., sales, use,\n",
      "value added, and some excise taxes). We have also elected to account for shipping and handling activities that occur after control of the related good transfers\n",

      "including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50\n",
      "percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We make adjustments to these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit\n",
      "or the refinement of an estimate due to new information. We classify the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that the company\n",
      "anticipates payment (or receipt) of cash within one year. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the “provision for income\n",
      "taxes.” Given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, we are unable to estimate the range of\n",

      "Business Combinations. We include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the purchase price of\n",
      "the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, except for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized\n",
      "in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is\n",
      "recorded as “goodwill.” Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred. See Note 2,\n",
      "“Acquisitions,” for additional information.\n",
      "Goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill is assessed for impairment on a reporting unit basis at least annually in the fourth quarter, as of September\n",
      "30, after the annual update to our long-term financial forecasts, or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill\n",
      "may be impaired. The impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, with an impairment charge recorded for the amount\n",
      "by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value up to a maximum amount of the goodwill balance for the reporting unit.\n",
      "Other intangible assets with finite lives consist primarily of developed technologies, trademarks, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, and\n",

      "guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the impairment testing guidance for goodwill. It\n",
      "allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value\n",
      "of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. The qualitative factors assist in determining whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is\n",

      "General Prohibition on Trading While in Possession of Material Non-Public Information\n",
      "If you possess information about Keysight that is both material and non-public, you are subject to trading restrictions. You cannot legally trade in (which\n",
      "includes buying, selling or gifting) Keysight securities, disclose such information to anyone, including your family, friends and colleagues, who may buy or sell\n",
      "securities because of the information (referred to as “tipping”), or make recommendations to anyone about trading in Keysight securities, until a reasonable\n",
      "time, usually the second trading day after Keysight issues a press release or Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filing disclosing the material non-\n",
      "public information that you possess. In addition, if you become aware of material, non-public information regarding another company which has a relationship\n",
      "with Keysight (such as customers, suppliers, vendors or other companies) that you obtained by virtue of your position at Keysight, then, similarly, you are\n",
      "prohibited from trading in that company’s securities while you are aware of that information or engaging in any other action to take advantage of that\n",
      "information, and you are prohibited from passing on the information to others to enable them to profit from it by trading in that company’s securities.\n",
      "Information is “material” if it would influence a reasonable person to buy or sell stock. Examples include undisclosed data reflecting orders, sales, earnings or\n",
      "profitability, or trends in these figures; impending announcements of major new products; significant cybersecurity incidents; major Keysight acquisitions,\n",
      "equity investments or divestitures; pending public offerings or private sales of debt/equity securities; senior management changes; and important developments\n",
      "in projects, alliances or litigation.\n",
      "Information is “non-public” if it hasn’t been the subject of a Keysight press release or SEC filing disclosing such information, or has otherwise not been widely\n",
      "disseminated to the public.\n",
      "Persons Covered\n",
      "This Policy applies to all of our directors, officers, employees as well as designated contractors, temporary workers or other individuals working on behalf of\n",
      "Keysight or its subsidiaries. The same restrictions that apply to you also apply to your family members who live in your household or are your dependents. In\n",
      "addition, this Policy applies to all corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies, trusts and other entities that are controlled by you or your family\n",
      "members who live in your household or are your dependents. You are responsible for making sure that any trading in securities covered by this Policy by any of\n",
      "these persons complies with this Policy.\n",
      "Trading Window Restrictions\n",
      "In addition to the general restriction described above, directors, officers and other Keysight employees who have access to interim financial information are\n",
      "prohibited from trading when the earnings trading window is closed. You will be notified by the Corporate Secretary or Assistant Secretary if you are\n",
      "considered a Restricted Person under this policy. The earnings trading window generally opens the second trading day after the public announcement of\n",
      "earnings and ends on the last trading day of the second month of Keysight’s fiscal quarter.\n",
      "However, please note that the dates for earnings releases may change on very short notice. In addition, the trading window may be shortened or eliminated\n",
      "under certain circumstances, of which any affected persons would be notified. Please feel free to check with Keysight’s Corporate Secretary or Assistant\n",
      "Secretary to make sure the earnings trading window is open.\n",
      "In certain cases, the Corporate Secretary or Assistant Secretary may notify specific individuals about special black-out periods that relate to events such as\n",
      "potential major Keysight acquisitions. Those individuals may not trade in Keysight securities during the special black-out period even if it coincides with an\n",
      "open trading window. Keysight will not announce special black-out periods to the company as a whole, and if you are notified or become aware of one you\n",
      "should not share that fact with others.\n",
      "What Constitutes Trading in Keysight Securities\n",
      "For purposes of this Policy, references to “trade” or “trading” in Keysight securities includes buying or selling Keysight shares in the open market; selling\n",
      "shares that were purchased under the Keysight employee stock purchase plan or issued upon exercise of a Keysight employee stock option; and transferring\n",
      "funds to or from a Keysight stock fund account in a Keysight U.S. 401(k) plan. It also includes, among other things, gifts of Keysight securities, as well as\n",
      "other direct or indirect transfers of Keysight securities.\n",
      "Prohibited trading does not include purchases of Keysight stock through the Keysight employee stock purchase plan or purchases, without sale, of shares\n",
      "through exercise of a Keysight stock option. Additionally, prohibited trading does not include transfers by will or the laws of descent or distribution and,\n",
      "provided that prior written notice is provided to the Corporate\n",
      "1\n",
      "Secretary or Assistant Secretary, distributions or transfers (such as certain tax planning or estate planning transfers) that effect only a change in the form of\n",
      "beneficial interest without changing the pecuniary interest of the person in Keysight securities.\n",
      "Written Trading Plans and Limit Orders\n",
      "The foregoing restrictions on trading, including the earnings trading window restrictions, do not apply to transactions which are executed pursuant to the terms\n",
      "of a qualified Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. To qualify as a 10b5-1 trading plan for purposes of this Policy, the plan must be pre-cleared by the Corporate Secretary\n",
      "or Assistant Secretary and entered into when the earnings trading window is open and when the employee is not aware of any material non-public information\n",
      "and otherwise comply with the requirements and procedures set forth in Appendix A hereto. It is the Company’s general policy to clear the use of Rule 10b5-1\n",
      "trading plans by those employees who are subject to the earnings trading window restrictions, or who otherwise as a result of their position with the Company,\n",
      "are regularly in possession of material inside information.\n",
      "There is no exception from the restrictions on insider trading and trading window restrictions for trades made under outstanding limit orders. Therefore, you\n",
      "may not have standing orders open for more than 5 business days at a time and must cancel any automatic orders during periods when you are subject to any\n",
      "insider trading restrictions.\n",
      "Restrictions on Hedging and Other Transactions\n",
      "Keysight policy prohibits directors, officers and other employees, as well as designated contractors, temporary workers or other individuals working on behalf\n",
      "of Keysight or its subsidiaries, from engaging in hedging transactions, such as purchasing or writing derivative securities including puts and calls and entering\n",
      "into collars, forward sale contracts, short sales or short positions, with respect to Keysight securities. Also, Keysight policy restricts directors and executive\n",
      "officers from buying Keysight stock on margin or pledging owned Keysight shares as collateral for loans or other indebtedness.\n",
      "Penalties for Insider Trading Violations\n",
      "If you violate insider trading laws, both you and Keysight may be subject to severe criminal penalties. You may also be liable for trading by your spouse,\n",
      "family members or others who trade on material non-public information disclosed by you. U.S. insider trading laws apply to all Keysight employees at any\n",
      "level, not merely to officers or managers. They apply to Keysight employees outside the U.S. who trade within the U.S. They apply even to relatively small\n",
      "transactions.\n",
      "Similar laws in other countries may apply to trading by Keysight employees who are located in those countries, or to trades in exchanges that are located there.\n",
      "Most of Europe is covered by insider trading restrictions under an EU directive and parallel national legislation.\n",
      "Separate and apart from any criminal penalties, employees who violate Keysight’s insider trading policies are subject to disciplinary action, which may include\n",
      "termination of employment, whether or not their failure to comply results in a violation of law. Keysight reserves the right to determine, in its own discretion\n",
      "and on the basis of information available to it, whether this Policy has been violated. It is not necessary for Keysight to await the filing or conclusion of a civil\n",
      "or criminal action against the alleged violator before taking disciplinary action.\n",
      "Transactions by Keysight\n",
      "Keysight will not engage in trading in Keysight securities, except in compliance with applicable securities laws.\n",
      "Reporting Violations\n",
      "Any director, officer or employee who violates this Policy or any applicable insider trading laws, or who knows of any violation by any other director, officer\n",
      "or employee, must report the violation immediately to the Corporate Secretary or Assistant Secretary. You may also contact Keysight’s Compliance Hotline\n",
      "using the information described at https://secure.ethicspoint.com/domain/media/en/gui/62494/index.html. Upon learning of a potential violation, the Corporate\n",
      "Secretary or Assistant Secretary, in consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, will determine whether Keysight should release any material non-\n",
      "public information, report the violation to the SEC or other appropriate governmental authority or take any other appropriate steps.\n",
      "2\n",
      "Appendix A\n",
      "10b5-1 Plan Requirements\n",
      "Persons covered by this Policy are permitted to effect transactions in Keysight securities pursuant to pre-cleared 10b5-1 trading plans. In order to qualify as a\n",
      "pre-cleared “10b5-1 trading plan” for purposes of this Policy, the plan must meet all of the following requirements:\n",
      "1. The 10b5-1 trading plan must be established in writing, signed and dated by the person establishing the plan and pre-cleared and, if applicable, certified by\n",
      "the Company, in each case prior to entry, with an executed copy submitted to Corporate Secretary or Assistant Secretary.\n",
      "2. The 10b5-1 trading plan must be in a form that meets the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the\n",
      "“Exchange Act”), and include certifications by the person entering into the plan that (i) such person is not aware of material non-public information at the time\n",
      "the plan is adopted; and (ii) such person has adopted the plan in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade the prohibitions of Rule 10b-5 under the\n",
      "Exchange Act.\n",
      "3. Each person establishing a 10b5-1 trading plan will operate the plan in good faith at all times during which it remains outstanding.\n",
      "4. A 10b5-1 trading plan may not be established during a time when a trading window restriction is in place (i.e., the earnings trading window is not open or a\n",
      "special black-out period applies) with respect to the person establishing the plan.\n",
      "5. For any 10b5-1 trading plan adopted by any “officer,” “director” (as defined under Rule 10b5-1), or employee, trading under the plan may not commence\n",
      "until the later of 90 days following the adoption of the plan, or 2 business days following the filing of Keysight’s form 10-Q or 10-K for the fiscal quarter in\n",
      "which the plan was adopted, provided that the maximum cooling-off period is 120 days.\n",
      "6. Except as provided below, persons subject to this Policy may not have more than one operative 10b5-1 trading plan at a time. Multiple plans are permitted in\n",
      "the following cases, subject to compliance with the requirements above and Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act:\n",
      "–\n",
      "Entry into a series of separate plans with separate brokers to execute trades, provided all meet the conditions of 10b5-1.\n",
      "–\n",
      "Entry into two separate plans with the same broker, provided that trades under the earlier adopted plan are complete before trades begin under the later\n",
      "adopted plan.\n",
      "–\n",
      "Entry into a plan to cover withholding obligations related to vesting of equity awards.\n",
      "7. Any amendment or modification to an existing 10b5-1 trading plan with respect to price, number of shares, or timing of purchase or sale, or similar changes,\n",
      "will be treated as a termination of the existing 10b5-1 trading plan and entry into a new 10b5-1 trading plan, which is subject to the same requirements above,\n",
      "including the applicable cooling-off period set forth in paragraph 5 of this Appendix A. The Corporate Secretary or Assistant Secretary must be notified in\n",

Our direct sales force focuses on addressing the needs of our global and regional customers by\\nselling Keysight products, systems, solutions, software, and services. Keysight’s direct sales force consists of sales and application engineers who have\\nin‑depth knowledge of the customers’ business and technology needs. Our direct sellers concentrate on providing more complex, end-to-end solutions where\\ncustomers require strategic consultation. Our application engineers bring deep solution and application expertise to provide a combination of consulting,\\nsystems integration and software engineering services that span all stages of the sale, deployment and support of our complex systems and solutions. We also\\nhave a global software subscription and renewals channel, selling our standalone enterprise software solutions including computer-aided engineering and\\ndesign workflow solutions. Together, all of our direct sales organizations serve customers globally across the commercial communications, aerospace, defense,\\nand government, automotive and energy, semiconductor and general electronics markets. More than 80 percent of our business comes from customer\\ninteractions with our direct sales organization.\\nTo complement our direct sales force, we have over 800 agreements with channel partners around the world. These channel partners include resellers,\\nmanufacturer’s representatives, and distributors. They serve thousands of customers across a wide range of end-user markets. They are expected to provide the\\nsame level of service and support as our direct sales force for the products they sell and generate new sales opportunities to extend our reach.

In connection with Agilent’s separation from HP, HP and Agilent entered into an agreement pursuant to which HP agreed\\nto retain the liability for this subsurface contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify Agilent with respect to claims arising out of that\\ncontamination. Agilent has assigned its rights and obligations under this agreement to Keysight in respect to facilities transferred to Keysight in our separation\\nfrom Agilent on November 1, 2014 (the “Separation”).

Supply chain fluctuations could impact\\nour ability to purchase parts and components. Some parts require custom design and may not be readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique\\ndesign or the length of time necessary for design work. Should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to re-engineer our\\nsolution. In addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. In\\norder to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into non-cancellable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times\\nmake advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands.

(“we,” “us,” “Keysight” or the “company”), incorporated in Delaware on December 6, 2013, is a global innovator in the\\ncomputing, communications and electronics market, committed to advancing our customers’ business success by helping them solve critical challenges in the\\ndevelopment and commercialization of their products and services. Our mission, “accelerating innovation to connect and secure the world,” speaks to the value\\nwe provide our customers in a world of ever-increasing technological complexity. We deliver this value through a broad range of design and test solutions that\\naddress the critical challenges our customers face in bringing their innovations to market on ever-shorter schedules.\\nOur fiscal year end is October 31. Unless otherwise stated, all years and dates refer to our fiscal year.\\nAcquisition of ESI Group SA\\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of ESI Group SA (“ESI Group”) for $935 million, net of cash acquired,\\nusing existing cash. For the year ended October 31, 2024, our acquisition of ESI Group resulted in incremental revenue of $141 million. In our discussion of\\nchanges in our results of operations, we have qualitatively disclosed the impact of the ESI Group acquisition. See Note 2, “Acquisitions,” for additional\\ninformation.\\nMacroeconomic environment\\nOur global operations continued to be affected by a challenging macro environment, including higher interest rates, currency movements, inflationary\\npressures, geopolitical tensions and trade restrictions. These factors resulted in lower demand, as our customers also exercised caution in light of the same\\nenvironment. Against this backdrop, we remained operationally disciplined by exercising our financial playbook and the structural flexibility in our operating\\nmodel, while investing to expand our differentiated solutions portfolio and deepening our customer relationships. Consistent with the Keysight Leadership\\nModel, our differentiated first-to-market solutions portfolio, technology leadership, customer relationships, and durable and resilient business model give us\\nconfidence in the long-term trajectory of the business and our ability to outperform in a variety of market conditions and deliver consistent long-term value to\\nour customers.\\nFor discussion of risks related to potential impacts of macroeconomic headwinds and geopolitical challenges on our operations, business results and\\nfinancial condition, see Part I Item 1A “Risk Factors.”\\n35\\nTable of Contents\\nYears ended October 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\\nOrders were $5,033 million, $5,190 million, and $5,984 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Net income of $614 million for 2024 decreased 42\\npercent compared to 2023, primarily driven by lower revenue, higher acquisition and integration costs, restructuring costs and amortization of acquisition-\\nrelated balances, partially offset by lower provision for income taxes, favorable gross margin impact from the ESI Group acquisition and lower people-related\\ncosts. Net income of $1,057 million for 2023 decreased 6 percent compared to 2022, primarily driven by higher income tax expense, R&D expense, and\\nselling, general and administrative expense, partially offset by higher interest income, higher revenue, and favorable mix.\\nCash flows generated from operating activities were $1,052 million, $1,408 million, and $1,144 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\\nOutlook\\nOur first-to-market solutions strategy enables customers to develop new technologies and accelerate innovation and provides a platform for Keysight's\\nlong-term growth. Our customers are expected to continue to make R&D investments in certain next-generation technologies and applications, including\\nevolution of 5G, early 6G, high-speed data center networks and infrastructure, satellite networks, Artificial Intelligence (“AI”), next generation electric vehicles\\nand autonomous vehicles, industrial internet of things (“IoT”), and defense modernization. We continue to engage actively with our customers, and closely\\nmonitor the current macroeconomic environment, including trade, tariffs, monetary and fiscal policies and geopolitical tensions. We remain confident in the\\nlong-term secular growth trends of our markets and our ability to outperform in a variety of market conditions.\\nCurrency Exchange Rate Exposure\\nOur revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global\\noperating, investing and financing activities. We hedge revenues, expenses, and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies\\nof our subsidiaries on a short-term and anticipated basis.

We experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations because our\\nhedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities. Our cash flow\\nhedging program is designed to hedge short-term currency movements based on a rolling period of up to twelve months. Therefore, we are exposed to currency\\nfluctuations over the longer term. To the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into\\nforeign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the U.S. dollar cost of the transaction.\\n36\\nTable of Contents\\nResults from Operations - Years ended October 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\\nA summary of our results is as follows:\\n\\xa0\\nYear Ended October\\xa031,\\n2024 over 2023\\n% Change\\n2023 over 2022\\n% Change\\n\\xa0\\n2024\\n2023\\n2022\\n(in millions, except margin data)\\nRevenue\\n$\\n4,979\\xa0\\n$\\n5,464\\xa0\\n$\\n5,420\\xa0\\n(9)%\\n1%\\nProducts\\n$\\n3,717\\xa0\\n$\\n4,336\\xa0\\n$\\n4,386\\xa0\\n(14)%\\n(1)%\\nPercentage of revenue\\n75\\xa0%\\n79\\xa0%\\n81\\xa0%\\n(5) ppts\\n(2) ppts\\nServices and other\\n$\\n1,262\\xa0\\n$\\n1,128\\xa0\\n$\\n1,034\\xa0\\n12%\\n9%\\nPercentage of revenue\\n25\\xa0%\\n21\\xa0%\\n19\\xa0%\\n5 ppts\\n2 ppts\\nGross margin\\n62.9\\xa0%\\n64.6\\xa0%\\n63.7\\xa0%\\n(2) ppts\\n1 ppt\\nProducts\\n60.9\\xa0%\\n64.2\\xa0%\\n63.3\\xa0%\\n(3) ppts\\n1 ppt\\nServices and other\\n68.8\\xa0%\\n66.3\\xa0%\\n64.9\\xa0%\\n2 ppts\\n1 ppt\\nResearch and development\\n$\\n919\\xa0\\n$\\n882\\xa0\\n$\\n841\\xa0\\n4%\\n5%\\nPercentage of revenue\\n18\\xa0%\\n16\\xa0%\\n16\\xa0%\\n2 ppts\\n1 ppt\\nSelling, general and administrative\\n$\\n1,395\\xa0\\n$\\n1,307\\xa0\\n$\\n1,283\\xa0\\n7%\\n2%\\nPercentage of revenue\\n28\\xa0%\\n24\\xa0%\\n24\\xa0%\\n4 ppts\\n—\\nOther operating expense (income), net\\n$\\n(14)\\n$\\n(15)\\n$\\n(8)\\n(6)%\\n80%\\nIncome from operations\\n$\\n833\\xa0\\n$\\n1,358\\xa0\\n$\\n1,334\\xa0\\n(39)%\\n2%\\nOperating margin\\n16.7\\xa0%\\n24.8\\xa0%\\n24.6\\xa0%\\n(8) ppts\\n—\\nInterest income\\n$\\n81\\xa0\\n$\\n102\\xa0\\n$\\n16\\xa0\\n(20)%\\n518%\\nInterest expense\\n$\\n(84)\\n$\\n(78)\\n$\\n(79)\\n9%\\n(1)%\\nOther income (expense), net\\n$\\n35\\xa0\\n$\\n(25)\\n$\\n14\\xa0\\n—\\n—\\nIncome before taxes\\n$\\n865\\xa0\\n$\\n1,357\\xa0\\n$\\n1,285\\xa0\\n(36)%\\n6%\\nProvision for income taxes\\n$\\n251\\xa0\\n$\\n300\\xa0\\n$\\n161\\xa0\\n(17)%\\n87%\\nNet income\\n$\\n614\\xa0\\n$\\n1,057\\xa0\\n$\\n1,124\\xa0\\n(42)%\\n(6)%\\nRevenue\\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to\\nreceive in exchange for those products or services.

Keysight entered into a new Singapore tax incentive agreement effective August 1, 2024. The Singapore tax\\nincentive provides lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and requires thresholds of investments and employment.\\nThe 2024 income tax charge was partially offset by a one-time income tax benefit of $165 million related to Global Intangible Low Taxed Income\\n(“GILTI”) tax deductions for intangible asset amortization. Keysight concluded that the U.S. Department of the Treasury exceeded its regulatory authority in\\nissuing tax regulations disallowing these deductions under IRC § 951A.

The tax rate in 2022 was lower than the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the proportion of worldwide earnings\\nthat are taxed at lower statutory tax rates in non-U.S. jurisdictions, partially offset by U.S. tax imposed on earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions. The increase in\\nthe effective tax rate of 9 percent from 2022 to 2023 was primarily due to a 5 percent increase from U.S. tax capitalization of research and experimental\\nexpenditures in 2023.\\nKeysight benefits from tax incentives in several jurisdictions, most significantly in Singapore and Malaysia.

We believe that we have an adequate provision for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the\\noutcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty. Given the numerous tax years and matters that remain subject to examination in various tax\\njurisdictions, the ultimate resolution of current and future tax examinations could be inconsistent with management’s current expectations. If that were to occur,\\nit could have an impact on our effective tax rate in the period in which such examinations are resolved.\\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although\\nthe guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an\\nuncertain tax position has met those thresholds requires significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for\\nuncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of\\nwhether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due.

Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve\\ndifficult, subjective, or complex judgments by management.

All of the following criteria must be met before we consider an agreement to qualify as a contract\\nwith a customer under the revenue standard: (i) it must be approved by all parties; (ii) each party’s rights regarding the goods and services to be\\ntransferred can be identified; (iii) the payment terms for the goods and services can be identified; (iv) the agreement has commercial substance; and,\\n(v) the customer has the ability and intent to pay and collection of substantially all of the consideration is probable. We exercise reasonable judgment\\nto determine the customer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based upon various factors including the customer’s historical payment experience or\\ncredit and financial information and credit risk management measures that we implement.\\n2.\\nIdentify the performance obligations in the contract: We assess whether each promised good or service is distinct for the purpose of identifying the\\nvarious performance obligations in each contract. Promised goods and services are considered distinct provided that: (i) the customer can benefit from\\nthe good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer; and, (ii) our promise to transfer the\\ngood or service to the customer is separately identifiable or distinct from other promises in the contract.\\n3.\\nDetermine the transaction price:\\xa0Transaction price reflects the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring\\ngoods or services. Our contracts may include terms that could cause variability in the transaction price including rebates, rights of return, trade-in\\ncredits, and discounts. Variable consideration is generally accounted for at the portfolio level and estimated based on historical information.\\n4.\\nAllocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract: If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire\\ntransaction price is allocated to that performance obligation. Many of our contracts include multiple performance obligations with a combination of\\ndistinct products and services, maintenance and support, professional services and/or training. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we\\nallocate the total transaction value to each distinct\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'chunk': 52}, page_content=' performance obligation based on relative SSP. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each\\ndistinct performance obligation. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a good or service when we sell that good or service separately\\nunder similar circumstances to similar customers. Since most contracts contain multiple performance obligations, we use information that may include\\nmarket conditions and other observable inputs to estimate SSP when we do not have standalone transactions.\\n5.\\nRecognize revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied:\\xa0 Revenue is recognized at the point in time control is transferred to the\\ncustomer. For hardware sales, transfer of control to the customer typically occurs at the point the product is shipped or delivered to the customer’s\\ndesignated location. For software license sales, transfer of control to the customer typically occurs upon shipment, electronic delivery, or when the\\nsoftware is available for download by the customer. For sales of implementation service and custom solutions or in instances where products are sold\\nalong with essential installation services, transfer of control occurs and revenue is typically recognized upon customer acceptance. For fixed-price\\nsupport and extended warranty contracts, or certain software arrangements that\\n48\\nTable of Contents\\nprovide customers with a right to access over a discrete period, control is deemed to transfer over time and revenue is recognized on a straight-line\\nbasis over the contract term due to the stand-ready nature of the performance obligation. Revenue from hardware repairs and calibration services\\noutside of an extended warranty or support contract is recognized at the time of completion of the related service. For other professional services or\\ntime-based labor contracts, revenue is recognized as we perform the services and the customer receives and/or consume the benefits.\\nInventory valuation.\\xa0We assess the valuation of our inventory periodically and adjust the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on future\\ndemand and actual usage. The excess balance determined by this analysis serves as the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our excess inventory review\\nprocess includes analyzing sales unit forecasts, managing product rollovers, and collaborating with manufacturing to maximize the recovery of excess\\ninventory, taking actual market and economic conditions into consideration.\\nShare-based compensation.\\xa0We account for share-based awards in accordance with the provisions of the authoritative accounting guidance, which requires\\nthe measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors. Awards granted under the\\nLong-Term Performance (“the LTP”) Program are based on a variety of targets, such as total shareholder return (“TSR”) or financial metrics such as operating\\nmargin. The awards based on TSR were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model and those based on financial metrics were valued based on the market\\nprice of Keysight’s common stock on the date of grant. The compensation cost for financial metrics-based performance awards reflects the cost of awards that\\nare probable to vest at the end of the performance period. The Monte Carlo simulation fair value model requires the use of highly subjective and complex\\nassumptions, including the price volatility of the underlying stock. For additional information on valuation assumptions, see Note 4, “Share-Based\\nCompensation.” The estimated fair value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the market price of Keysight’s common stock on the date of grant.\\nWe did not grant any option awards in 2024, 2023 and 2022.\\nRetirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions.\\xa0Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. They\\nrepresent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. Defined benefit plan obligations are\\nremeasured at least annually as of October 31, based on the present value of future benefit payments to reflect the future benefit costs over the employees’\\naverage expected future service to Keysight based on the terms of the plans. To estimate the present value of these future payments, we are required to make\\nassumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of generally'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'chunk': 53}, page_content=' accepted accounting principles in the U.S. The discount rate is a critical assumption.\\nOther important assumptions include expected long-term return on plan assets, expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments,\\nexpected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates and investment portfolio composition. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually.\\nSee Note 12, “Retirement Plans and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans.”\\nThe discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date, which is October\\xa031 for both U.S. and non-\\nU.S. plans. The U.S. discount rates as of October 31, 2024 and 2023 were determined based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with\\ncash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. The non-U.S. discount rates as of October\\xa031, 2024 and 2023 were determined using spot rates\\nalong the yield curve to calculate disaggregated discount rates. In addition, we used this method to calculate two components of the periodic benefit cost:\\nservice cost and interest cost. If we changed our discount rate by 1 percent, the impact would be $6 million on U.S. net periodic benefit cost and $13 million on\\nnon-U.S. net periodic benefit cost. Lower discount rates increase the present value of the liability and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates\\ndecrease the present value of the liability and subsequent year pension expense.\\nThe company uses alternate methods of amortization, as allowed by the authoritative guidance, that amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent\\nbasis for the years presented. For U.S. plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average future working lifetime. For most non-U.S. plans and U.S. post-\\nretirement benefit plans, gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each year’s gains and losses. The expected long-term return on plan assets is\\nestimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns. Plan assets are valued at fair value. If we changed our\\nestimated return on assets by 1\\xa0percent, the impact would be $7 million on U.S. net periodic benefit cost and $8\\xa0million on non-U.S. net periodic benefit cost.\\nBusiness combinations. Our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques.\\nWe allocate the purchase price paid for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions based on their estimated fair values at the\\ntime of acquisition, which involves a number of assumptions, estimates, and judgments, which are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. We\\ndetermine the estimated fair values with the assistance of valuations performed by third party specialists, discounted cash flow analysis, and estimates made by\\nmanagement. Our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value estimates may be affected by changes in our financial condition, financial\\nperformance, or business strategies. Our assumptions and estimates are based upon comparable\\n49\\nTable of Contents\\nmarket data and information obtained from our management and the management of the acquired companies. These assumptions and estimates are used to\\nvalue assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and to allocate goodwill to the reporting units of the business that are expected to benefit from the business\\ncombination. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we may recognize adjustments to the assets\\nacquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially\\nrecorded in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. We continue to collect information and reevaluate these estimates and\\nassumptions quarterly and record any adjustment to our preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period. Upon the\\nconclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent\\nadjust'),\n",

We review goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in\\ncircumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. As defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one\\nlevel below an operating segment. At the time of an acquisition, we assign goodwill to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the\\ncombination.\\nCompanies have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether performing a quantitative test is necessary. If an entity believes, as a\\nresult of its qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative\\nimpairment test will be required. Otherwise, no further testing will be required.\\nThe quantitative impairment test involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. We\\ndetermine the fair value of a reporting unit from the results derived using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach, or a\\ncombination of both. If multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted accordingly. The income approach is estimated through the\\ndiscounted cash flow (“DCF”) analysis. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment, including judgments about appropriate discount\\nrates, revenue growth rates, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. Discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital\\n(“WACC”), which represents the average rate a business must pay its providers of debt and equity, plus a risk premium. The WACC used to test goodwill is\\nderived from a group of comparable companies. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are derived from internal forecasts and external market\\nforecasts. The market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by utilizing the market comparable method, which is based on revenue and\\nearnings multiples from comparable companies. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not\\nimpaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the\\ncarrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value up to a maximum amount of the goodwill balance for the reporting unit.\\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill for all our reporting units using a qualitative approach. Based on\\nthe results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than its respective carrying\\nvalue. There were no impairments of goodwill during the years ended October 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\\nOther intangible assets consist primarily of developed technologies, trademarks, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, and backlog and are\\namortized using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 12 years. We review other intangible assets for impairment whenever\\nevents or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets\\nare no longer appropriate. No impairments of amortizable intangible assets were recorded during the years ended October 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\\nWe review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the\\nassets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. The authoritative accounting guidance allows a qualitative\\napproach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the impairment testing guidance for goodwill. It allows the option to first assess\\nqualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the'),\n",

An organization may\\nchoose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. Our\\nindefinite-lived intangible assets are generally in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) intangible assets. No impairments of indefinite-lived intangible\\nassets were recorded in 2024. We had no IPR&D intangible assets as of October 31, 2023 and 2022.\\nWarranty.\\xa0Keysight warranties on products sold through direct sales channels are primarily for one year. Warranties for products sold through distribution\\nchannels are primarily for three years. We accrue for standard warranty costs based on\\n50\\nTable of Contents\\nhistorical trends in warranty charges. The accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates. Estimated\\nwarranty charges are recorded within “cost of products” at the time related product revenue is recognized.\\nWe also sell extended warranties that provide warranty coverage beyond the standard warranty term. Revenue associated with extended warranties is\\ndeferred and recognized over the extended coverage period.\\nLoss Contingencies. As discussed in Note 14, “Commitments and Contingencies” to the consolidated financial statements, we are, from time to time,\\nsubject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to our business (or the business operations of previously owned entities). We\\nrecognize a liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. These assessments require judgments concerning\\nmatters such as litigation developments and outcomes, the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and\\nfuture claims. In addition, because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to various factors.\\nChanges in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations.\\nRestructuring.\\xa0 The main component of our existing restructuring plans is related to workforce reductions and site restructuring. Workforce reduction\\ncharges are accrued when payment of benefits becomes probable and the amounts can be estimated. If the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring\\nactivities are significantly different from what we have estimated, the actual amount of restructuring and other related charges could be materially different,\\neither higher or lower, than those we have recorded.\\nAccounting for income taxes.\\xa0We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes.\\xa0These\\nestimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax benefits, credits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from\\ndifferences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes.\\xa0Significant changes to these estimates may result in an\\nincrease or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.\\nSignificant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part.\\xa0When it is more likely than\\nnot that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized, a valuation\\nallowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized. We consider all available positive and negative evidence on a\\njurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. We consider evidence such as our\\npast operating results, the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. As of October 31, 2024, the company maintains a\\nvaluation allowance mainly related to net operating losses in Luxembourg, capital losses and net operating losses in the U.K., and California research credits\\nfrom acquired entities that are subject to change in ownership limitations.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\nAt various times, we use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Because\\nderivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes, fluctuations in the market values of such derivative instruments are\\ngenerally offset by reciprocal changes in the underlying economic exposures that the instruments are intended to hedge. For further discussion of derivative\\nfinancial instruments, see Note 9, “Derivatives.”\\nCurrency exchange rate risk\\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, expenses, assets and liabilities denominated\\nin currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries. We hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency\\nusing sales and expense forecasts on a rolling period of up to twelve months. Our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprise-wide basis. This\\nstrategy utilizes derivative financial instruments, primarily forward contracts, to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and\\nlosses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them. We do not currently and do not intend to utilize\\nderivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes. To the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign\\ncurrencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the cost of the transaction.\\nOur operations generate non-functional currency cash flows such as revenue, third-party vendor payments, and inter-company payments. In anticipation of\\nthese foreign currency cash flows and in view of the volatility of the currency market, we enter into foreign exchange contracts as described above to\\nsubstantially mitigate our currency risk. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, approximately 71 percent, 75 percent, and 77 percent, respectively, of our revenues were\\ngenerated in U.S. dollars.\\nThe unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, principally as a result of the strength of the U.S. dollar, had an immaterial impact\\non our revenue in the year ended October\\xa031, 2024.

Generally, the fair market value of fixed-rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise.\\nAs of October 31, 2024, a hypothetical 10 percent increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the company’s fixed-rate debt by\\napproximately $41 million. However, since the company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixed-rate instruments before their maturity, nor\\ndo the investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity, the impact of market interest rate\\nfluctuations on the company’s fixed-rate long-term debt does not affect the company’s results of operations or stockholders’ equity.\\n52\\nTable of Contents\\nItem\\xa08.

Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company\\'s\\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\\n(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the\\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence\\nregarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control\\nover financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other\\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\\nAs described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded ESI Group SA. (\"ESI Group\"), Riscure\\nHolding B.V (\"Riscure\") and AnaPico AG (\"AnaPico\") from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2024, because they\\nwere acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during 2024. We have also excluded ESI Group, Riscure and AnaPico from our audit of\\ninternal control over financial reporting. ESI Group is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management’s\\nassessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent approximately 1% and 3%, respectively, while Riscure and AnaPico, wholly-\\nowned subsidiaries, each constituted less than 1% of total assets and total revenues of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the\\nyear ended October 31, 2024.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and\\nthe preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

During January 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of the remaining share capital of ESI Group\\nfor $458 million, using existing cash. Of the acquired other intangible assets, $270 million of developed technology and $160 million of customer relationships\\nwere recorded. The intangible assets were valued by management using different income approach methods, which included the multi-period excess earnings\\nand with and without valuation methods for developed technology and customer relationships, respectively. The significant assumptions used to estimate the\\nfair value of the acquired intangible assets included revenue growth rates, earnings before interest and taxes, customer attrition rate, discount rate, obsolescence\\nrate and total operating expenses.\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of developed technology and customer relationships\\nacquired in the acquisition of ESI Group is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the\\ndeveloped technology and customer relationships acquired; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and\\nevaluating management’s significant assumption related to earnings before interest and taxes; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with\\nspecialized skill and knowledge.\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated\\nfinancial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over\\nmanagement’s valuation of the developed technology and customer relationships acquired. These procedures also included, among others (i) reading the\\npurchase agreement; (ii) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of the developed technology and customer relationships acquired;\\n(iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings and with and without valuation methods used by management; (iv) testing the\\ncompleteness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the multi-period excess earnings and with and without valuation methods; and (v) evaluating the\\nreasonableness of the significant assumption used by management related to earnings before interest and taxes. Evaluating management's assumption related to\\nearnings before interest and taxes involved considering (i) the current and past performance of ESI Group; (ii) the consistency with external market and\\nindustry data; and (iii) whether the assumption was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.

(“we,” “us,” “Keysight” or the “company”), incorporated in Delaware on December 6, 2013, is a global innovator\\nin the computing, communications and electronics market, committed to advancing our customers’ business success by helping them solve critical challenges\\nin the development and commercialization of their products and services. Our mission, “accelerating innovation to connect and secure the world,” speaks to\\nthe value we provide our customers in a world of ever-increasing technological complexity. We deliver this value through a broad range of design and test\\nsolutions that address the critical challenges our customers face in bringing their innovations to market on ever-shorter schedules.\\nBasis of Presentation.\\xa0We have prepared the accompanying financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\\nCommission (“SEC”) and in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”). Our fiscal year end is October 31. Unless\\notherwise stated, all years and dates refer to our fiscal year.\\nManagement is responsible for the fair presentation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with GAAP, and has\\nfull responsibility for their integrity and accuracy. In the opinion of management, the accompanying consolidated financial statements contain all normal and\\nrecurring adjustments necessary to present fairly our consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of operations, consolidated statement of\\ncomprehensive income, consolidated statement of cash flows and consolidated statement of equity.\\nPrinciples of consolidation.\\xa0The consolidated'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'chunk': 64}, page_content=\" financial statements include the accounts of the company and our wholly- and majority-owned subsidiaries.\\nAll significant inter-company transactions have been eliminated. The consolidated financial statements also reflect the impact of non-controlling interests. Non-\\ncontrolling interests do not have a significant impact on the consolidated results of operations; therefore, net income attributable to non-controlling interests for\\nthe year ended October 31, 2024 of $4 million is not presented separately and is included in “other income (expense), net” in the consolidated statements of\\noperations.\\nUse of Estimates.\\xa0The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\\nthe amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various\\nother assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the\\ncompany in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. We are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update\\nto our estimates or judgments or a revision of the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of October\\xa031, 2024. Our critical accounting policies are those that\\naffect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition,\\ninventory valuation, share-based compensation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, business combinations, valuation of goodwill and other\\nintangible assets, warranty, loss contingencies, restructuring and accounting for income taxes.\\nRevenue recognition. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the\\nconsideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We primarily generate revenue from the sale of products (hardware and/or\\nsoftware), services, or a combination thereof. We enter into contracts that may involve multiple performance obligations, and we allocate the transaction price\\nbetween each performance obligation on the basis of relative standalone selling price (“SSP”). Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any\\ntaxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\\n61\\nTable of Contents\\nProduct revenues are generated predominantly from the sale of various types of design and test software and hardware. Products consist of standalone\\nsoftware and hardware generally installed with software applications that are licensed on a perpetual and term basis. Our hardware products generally do not\\nhave any substantive acceptance terms that would otherwise preclude the transfer of control. Performance obligations related to our software licenses, including\\nthe license portion of our software subscriptions, grant the customer the right to use our software primarily via electronic delivery.\\nService revenues consist of repair and calibration services, extended warranties, technical support for hardware and software, when-and-if available\\nsoftware updates and upgrades, and professional services, including installation and implementation, consulting, and training. Services include both hardware\\nand software services. Repair and calibration services for hardware products are sold both as per-incident customer services and as customer agreements to\\nprovide such services over the contractual period. Extended warranties are optional to the customer and provide warranty on hardware products for additional\\nyears beyond the standard one-year warranty. Technical support for software and when-and-if available software updates and upgrades are sold either together\\nwith our software licenses and software subscriptions, or separately as part of our customer support programs. These are considered stand-ready performance\\nobligations where customers benefit from the services evenly throughout the license or service period. Our professional services may be sold on a time and\\nmaterial basis (e.g., consulting) or on a fixed-fee basis (e.g., non-recurring engineering).\\nWe also generate revenues from a combination of products and services (“custom solutions”), including combinations of hardware, software, software\\nsubscriptions, installation, professional services, and other support services. Custom solutions provide the customer with a combination of hardware, software\\nand professional services to meet customers' unique specifications and are accounted for as one performance\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'chunk': 65}, page_content=' obligation.\\nFor our contracts with customers, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. Our standard payment terms are net 30\\nto 90 days, and we generally do not offer extended payment terms beyond one year. Our contracts typically contain various forms of variable consideration,\\nincluding trade discounts, trade-in credits, rebates, and rights of return. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations based on\\nrelative SSP. SSPs for a majority of our products and services are estimated based on our established pricing practices and maximize the use of observable\\ninputs. An observable input is the price of the good or service when it is sold as a separate item in a similar circumstance and to a similar customer as in the\\ncontract for which SSPs are being determined. We have elected to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental\\nauthority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected by Keysight from a customer (e.g., sales, use,\\nvalue added, and some excise taxes). We have also elected to account for shipping and handling activities that occur after control of the related good transfers\\nas fulfillment activities instead of assessing such activities as performance obligations.\\n62\\nTable of Contents\\nOur typical performance obligations include the following:\\nPerformance obligation\\nWhen performance obligation is\\ntypically satisfied\\nWhen payment is typically due\\nHow standalone selling price is\\ntypically determined\\nProduct Revenues\\nHardware\\nWhen customer obtains control of the\\nproduct, typically at delivery (point in\\ntime)\\nWithin 30-90 days of shipment\\nEstimated based on established pricing\\npractices or observable based on\\nstandalone sales for certain hardware\\nproducts\\nSoftware licenses\\nPrimarily upon electronic delivery of\\nthe software, and the applicable\\nlicense period has begun (point in\\ntime)\\nWithin 30-90 days of the beginning of\\nlicense period\\nEstimated based on established pricing\\npractices or observable based on\\nstandalone sales for certain software\\nproducts\\nSoftware subscriptions\\nRatably over the subscription period\\n(over time)\\nWithin 30-90 days of the beginning of\\nsubscription period\\nEstimated based on established pricing\\npractices\\nService Revenues\\nCalibration contracts\\nRatably over the service contract\\nperiod (over time)\\nWithin 30-90 days of the beginning of\\nservice contract period\\nEstimated based on established pricing\\npractices\\nRepair and calibration (per- incident) As services are performed (point in\\ntime)\\nWithin 30-90 days of invoicing for\\nservices rendered\\nEstimated based on established pricing\\npractices\\nExtended hardware warranty\\nRatably over the warranty period\\n(over time)\\nWithin 30-90 days of invoicing\\nEstimated based on established pricing\\npractices or observable based on\\nstandalone sales of certain hardware\\nwarranty contracts\\nTechnical support and when-and-if-\\navailable software updates\\nRatably over the license service\\ncontract period (over time)\\nWithin 30-90 days of the beginning of\\nlicense or service contract period\\nEstimated based on established pricing\\npractices or observable based on\\nstandalone sales for certain support\\ncontracts\\nProfessional services\\nAs services are performed based on\\nmeasures of progress (over time) or at\\na point in time\\nWithin 30-90 days of invoicing for\\nservices rendered\\nEstimated based on established pricing\\npractices\\nCustom Solutions\\nCustom solutions (milestone-based;\\npercentage-of-completion)\\nAs milestones are achieved based on\\ntransfer of control to customer (over\\ntime)\\nWithin 30-90 days of milestone\\nachievement\\nTransaction price, as pricing is custom\\nand can vary significantly from contract\\nto contract\\nCustom solutions (point in time)\\nWhen customer obtains control of the\\nsolution, typically at delivery or\\ncustomer acceptance, as defined by\\nthe contract (point in time)\\nWithin 30-90 days of delivery of\\nsolution'),\n",

In doing so, we consider our\\ninternal price list for each product and service, which reflects our desired profitability, based on an expected level of sales, and adjust for factors such as\\ncompetition, customer relationship, discount provided in the contract, geographic location, and the products and services purchased in the arrangement. We use\\na range based on actual historical sales to determine whether the calculated SSP for a product or service is a fair representation of the SSP.\\nFor capitalized contract costs, we use judgment in determining the capitalized amount and amortization period.\\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, and we may provide other credits, discounts, or incentives, which are accounted for as variable\\nconsideration at the portfolio level and estimated based on historical information. Returns, credits, and discounts are estimated at contract inception and\\nupdated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of the cumulative\\namount of revenue recognized will not occur once the variability is subsequently resolved. See Note 3, “Revenue,” for additional information.\\nShipping and handling costs.\\xa0Our shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in “revenue” and the associated expense is recorded in\\n“cost of products” for all periods presented.\\nDeferred revenue.\\xa0We recognize contract liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as deferred revenue, which represents the amount of service and\\nsoftware revenue deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. In addition, it includes the\\namount allocated to undelivered performance obligations.\\nAccounts receivable, net.\\xa0Trade accounts receivable is recorded at the invoiced amount and does not bear interest. Such accounts receivable has been\\nreduced by an allowance for credit losses, which is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine\\nthe allowance based on customer specific experience and the aging of such receivables, among other factors. The allowance for credit losses was approximately\\n$9 million and $5\\xa0million, respectively, as of October 31, 2024 and 2023.\\nShare-based compensation. We account for share-based awards made to our employees and directors, including restricted stock units (“RSUs”), employee\\nstock purchases made under our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”), employee stock option awards, and performance share awards under our Long-Term\\nPerformance (“the LTP”) Program, using the estimated grant date fair value on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. Forfeitures\\nare recognized as they occur and are reductions from share-based compensation expense. See Note 4, “Share-Based Compensation,” for additional information.\\nInventory.\\xa0Inventory is valued at standard cost, which approximates actual cost computed on a first-in, first-out basis, not exceeding net realizable value.\\nWe assess the valuation of our inventory periodically and adjust the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on future demand and actual\\nusage. See Note 13, “Supplemental Financial Information,” for additional information.\\nWarranty.\\xa0Keysight warranties on products sold through direct sales channels are primarily for one year. Warranties for products sold through distribution\\nchannels are primarily for three years. We accrue for standard warranty costs based on historical trends in warranty charges. The accrual is reviewed regularly\\nand periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates. Estimated warranty charges are recorded within “cost of products” at the'),\n",

See Note 13, “Supplemental Financial Information,” for additional information.\\nWe also sell extended warranties that provide warranty coverage beyond the standard warranty term. Revenue associated with extended warranties is\\ndeferred and recognized over the extended coverage period.\\nLoss contingencies. We accrue for probable losses from contingencies, including legal settlement costs, on an undiscounted basis when such costs are\\nconsidered probable of being incurred and are reasonably estimable. We periodically evaluate available information, both internal and external, relative to such\\ncontingencies and adjust this accrual as necessary.\\nTaxes on income.\\xa0Income tax expense is based on income or loss before taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between\\nasset and liability amounts that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes. These deferred\\ntaxes are measured by applying currently enacted tax laws. Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely\\nthan not to be realized.\\n64\\nTable of Contents\\nWe account for uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax\\nposition for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit,\\nincluding resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50\\npercent likely of being realized upon settlement. We make adjustments to these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit\\nor the refinement of an estimate due to new information. We classify the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that the company\\nanticipates payment (or receipt) of cash within one year. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the “provision for income\\ntaxes.” Given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, we are unable to estimate the range of\\npossible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 5, “Income Taxes,” for additional information.\\nBusiness Combinations. We include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the purchase price of\\nthe acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, except for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized\\nin accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is\\nrecorded as “goodwill.” Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred. See Note 2,\\n“Acquisitions,” for additional information.\\nGoodwill and other intangible assets.\\xa0Goodwill is assessed for impairment on a reporting unit basis at least annually in the fourth quarter, as of September\\n30, after the annual update to our long-term financial forecasts, or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill\\nmay be impaired. The impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, with an impairment charge recorded for the amount\\nby which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value up to a maximum amount of the goodwill balance for the reporting unit.\\nOther intangible assets with finite lives consist primarily of developed technologies, trademarks, customer relationships, non-compete agreements, and\\nacquired backlog and are amortized using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 1 to 12 years. We review other intangible assets for\\nimpairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the\\nuseful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate.\\nOther intangible assets with indefinite-lives are generally in-process research and development (“IPR&D”)'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'chunk': 68}, page_content=' intangible assets. The authoritative accounting\\nguidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the impairment testing guidance for goodwill. It\\nallows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value\\nof the indefinite-lived intangible asset. The qualitative factors assist in determining whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is\\nimpaired. An organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to\\ncalculating its fair value.\\nSee Note 2, “Acquisitions,” and Note 7, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” for additional information about our goodwill and other intangible assets.\\nImpairment of long-lived assets.\\xa0We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets\\nmay not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the\\ncarrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than\\nthe carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets.\\nAdvertising. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were $18 million in 2024, $24 million in 2023 and $27 million in 2022.\\nResearch and development. Costs related to the research, design and development of our products are charged to research and development (“R&D”)\\nexpense as they are incurred.\\nGovernment assistance. Keysight receives various forms of government assistance, primarily through grants related to the development of new products\\nand tax credits related to capital expenditures. We record proceeds from government grants when there is reasonable assurance that we will comply with the\\nrelevant conditions of the grant agreement and the grant funds will be received. Grants in recognition of specific expenses are recognized in the same period as\\nan offset to those related expenses. Grants in form of tax credits related to capital expenditures are recognized as a reduction to property, plant and equipment\\nwith a corresponding reduction to depreciation expense over the expected useful life of the related asset.\\n65\\nTable of Contents\\nGrants received from new or existing arrangements in 2024 and 2023 were $8 million and $4 million, respectively, and are recorded as an offset to\\n“research and development” in the consolidated statement of operations. Grant proceeds receivable as of October 31, 2024 and 2023 were $6 million and $5\\nmillion, respectively, and are recorded in “other current assets” in the consolidated balance sheet. Grant proceeds received prior to Keysight meeting the\\nconditions of the grant are recorded in “other accrued liabilities” and “other long-term liabilities” in the consolidated balance sheet and were $4 million as of\\nOctober 31, 2024 and not material as of October 31, 2023. Grant income recorded in “other income (expense), net” in the consolidated statement of operations\\nwas not material for fiscal year 2024 and 2023.\\nTax credits related to capital expenditures reduced property, plant and equipment by $7 million and $1 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\\nInvestments. Investments with readily determinable fair values and trading securities are reported at fair value. Equity investments without readily\\ndeterminable fair values are measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments. Gains or losses resulting from changes in fair\\nvalue are recognized currently in earnings. The company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the\\ncarrying value of an investment may not be recoverable.\\nFair value of financial instruments.\\xa0The carrying values of certain of our financial instruments, including cash'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'chunk': 69}, page_content=' and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,\\naccounts payable and other accrued liabilities, approximate fair value because of their short maturities. The fair value of long-term equity investments is\\ndetermined using quoted market prices for those securities when available. For those long-term equity investments accounted for under the equity method or a\\nmeasurement alternative, the carrying value approximates estimated fair value. The fair value of foreign currency contracts used for hedging purposes is\\nestimated internally by using inputs tied to active markets. These inputs, for example, interest rate yield curves, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot\\nprices for currencies, are observable in the market or\\xa0can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\\nSee Note\\xa08, “Fair Value Measurements,” for additional information.\\nNet income per share.\\xa0Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding\\nduring the period excluding the dilutive effect of share-based awards. Diluted net income per share gives effect to all potentially dilutive common stock\\nequivalents outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of share-based awards is reflected in diluted net income per share by application of the treasury\\nstock method, which includes consideration of unamortized share-based compensation expense, and the dilutive effect of in-the-money options, non-vested\\nRSUs, LTP program awards and potential ESPP issuances. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options\\nand unamortized share-based compensation expense are assumed proceeds to be used to repurchase hypothetical shares. Potentially dilutive shares whose effect\\nwould have been antidilutive are excluded from the computation of diluted net income per share. See Note 6, “Net Income Per Share,” for additional\\ninformation.\\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.\\xa0We classify investments as cash equivalents if their original maturity or remaining maturity at the time\\nof purchase is three months or less at the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.\\nOur cash and cash equivalents mainly consist of investments in institutional money market funds, short-term deposits held at major global financial\\ninstitutions, and similar short duration instruments with original maturities of three months or less. We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of the\\nfinancial institutions in which we invest our funds. We utilize a variety of funding strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the\\nlocations in which it is needed. Most significant international locations have access to internal funding through an offshore cash pool for working capital needs.\\nIn addition, a few locations that are unable to access internal funding have access to temporary local overdraft and short-term working capital lines of credit.\\nWe classify investments as short-term investments if their original maturities are greater than three months and their remaining maturities are one year or\\nless.\\nConcentration of credit risk.\\xa0Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk principally includes cash and cash equivalents,\\nshort-term and long-term investments, derivative financial instruments and accounts receivables. Cash and cash equivalents primarily consists of money market\\nfund investments, time deposits and demand deposit balances. We invest in a variety of financial instruments and limit the amount of credit exposure with any\\none financial institution. We have a comprehensive credit policy in place and credit exposure is monitored on an ongoing basis.\\n66\\nTable of Contents\\nCredit risk with respect to our accounts receivable is diversified due to the large number of entities comprising our customer base and their dispersion\\nacross many different industries and geographies. Credit evaluations are performed on customers requiring credit over a certain amount.\\nCredit risk is mitigated through collateral, such as letters of credit, bank guarantees or payment terms like cash in advance.

We enter into foreign\\nexchange hedging contracts and primarily use forward contracts to manage financial exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\\nForeign currency exposures include committed and anticipated revenue and expense transactions (cash flow exposure) and monetary assets and liabilities that\\nare denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary (balance sheet exposure). For cash flow hedges, contracts are designated at\\ninception as hedges of the related foreign currency exposures. We formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well\\nas our risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions at the inception of the hedge. This process includes linking all\\nderivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to specific forecasted transactions. We also formally assess, both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing\\nbasis, whether the hedging instruments are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. Our foreign exchange cash flow hedging\\ncontracts have maturities based on a rolling period of up to twelve months. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.\\nAll derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair values. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges,\\nchanges in the value of the effective portion of the derivative instruments are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of\\nstockholders' equity. Amounts associated with cash flow hedges are reclassified and recognized in income when either the forecast transaction occurs or it\\nbecomes probable the forecast transaction will not occur. Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value, and\\nchanges in fair value are recorded in earnings in the current period. Derivative instruments are subject to master netting arrangements with the respective\\ncounterparties to allow for net settlement under certain conditions. Cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the statement of cash flows in the\\nsame category as the cash flows from the hedged or economically hedged item, primarily in operating activities. See Note 9, “Derivatives,” for additional\\ninformation.\\nProperty, plant and equipment. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Additions, improvements and major\\nrenewals are capitalized; maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or disposed of, the assets and related\\naccumulated depreciation are removed from our general ledger, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statement of operations. We use\\nthe straight-line method to depreciate assets. Buildings and improvements are depreciated over the lesser of their useful lives, which is generally over five years\\nto forty years, or the remaining term of the lease; and machinery and equipment is generally depreciated over three years to ten years. See Note 13,\\n“Supplemental Financial Information,” for additional information.\\nLeases. We determine whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in “operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets” and\\n“operating lease liabilities” (current and non-current) on our consolidated balance sheet. Finance leases are included in “property, plant and equipment, net,”\\n“other accrued liabilities,” and “other long-term liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet. Our finance lease and lessor arrangements were immaterial in\\n2024, 2023 and 2022.\\nROU assets and lease obligations are recognized based on their present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement\\ndate. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term and economic environment to\\ndiscount lease obligations. ROU assets also include any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred.\"),\n",

Variable payments that do not depend on an index are not included\\nin the lease liability and are recognized as they are incurred. See Note 10, “Leases,” for additional information.\\nRestructuring costs. The main component of our existing restructuring plans is related to workforce reductions and site restructuring. Workforce reduction\\ncharges are accrued when payment of benefits becomes probable and the amounts can be estimated. If the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring\\nactivities are significantly different from what we have estimated, the actual amount of restructuring and other related charges could be materially different,\\neither higher or lower, than those we have recorded.\\nEmployee compensation and benefits. Amounts owed to employees, such as accrued salary, bonuses and vacation benefits are reported within employee\\ncompensation and benefits in the consolidated balance sheet. The total amount of accrued vacation benefit was $114 million and $113 million as of October 31,\\n2024 and 2023, respectively.\\n67\\nTable of Contents\\nForeign currency translation.\\xa0We translate and remeasure balance sheet and statement of operations items into U.S. dollars. For those subsidiaries that\\noperate in a local currency functional environment, all assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates at the balance sheet\\ndate; revenue and expenses are translated using monthly exchange rates that approximate average exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are\\nreported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders\\' equity in our consolidated balance sheet.\\nFor those subsidiaries that operate in a U.S. dollar functional environment, foreign currency assets and liabilities are re-measured into U.S. dollars at\\ncurrent exchange rates except for non-monetary assets and capital accounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are\\ngenerally remeasured at monthly exchange rates that approximate average exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency re-measurement are included\\nin “net income.” Net gains or losses resulting from foreign currency asset and liability remeasurement transactions are reported in other income (expense), net\\nand were a $19 million gain in 2024, a $49 million loss in 2023 and a $1 million loss in 2022. See Note 9, “Derivatives” for additional information.\\nRetirement plans and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions. Defined benefit plan obligations are remeasured at least annually as of October 31, based\\non the present value of future benefit payments to reflect future benefit costs over the employees\\' average expected future service to Keysight based on the\\nterms of the plans. To estimate the present value of these future payments, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework\\nof GAAP. Two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Other important assumptions include expected future\\nsalary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates and investment portfolio\\ncomposition. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually.

The company entered\\ninto put/call agreements valued at $7 million for certain ESI Group equity awards, subject to a holding period that may extend beyond the explicit vesting\\nperiod, for the right to receive a cash payment equal to the public tender offer consideration of 155 euros per share, which was substantially paid in the third\\nquarter of fiscal year 2024. For the year ended October 31, 2024, ESI Group's net revenue was $141 million\\xa0and net loss attributable to Keysight shareholders\\nwas $68 million.\\nThe ESI Group acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the authoritative accounting guidance. The acquired assets and assumed liabilities were\\nrecorded at their estimated fair values. We determined the estimated fair values with the assistance of valuations performed by third party specialists,\\ndiscounted cash flow analysis, and estimates made by management. The acquisition of ESI Group expands our application layer portfolio with simulation\\ncapabilities that are critical to accelerate innovation in multiple end markets. These factors, among others, contributed to a purchase price in excess of the\\nestimated fair value of ESI Group's net identifiable assets acquired (see summary of net assets below), and, as a result, we have recorded goodwill in\\nconnection with this transaction.\\nGoodwill was assigned to the Communications Solutions Group (“CSG”) and the Electronic Industrial Solutions Group (“EISG”) reportable segments,\\nbased on the expected benefits and synergies that are likely to be realized from the ESI Group acquisition. We do not expect the goodwill recognized or any\\npotential impairment charges in the future to be deductible for income tax purposes.\\nA portion of the overall purchase price was allocated to acquired intangible assets.

The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be\\nissued under the plan is 28 million. The plan provides for the grants of awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs,\\nperformance-based shares and units, and cash awards. As of October 31, 2024, approximately 9\\xa0million shares were available for future awards.\\nRSUs under our share-based plans are granted to directors, executives and employees. The estimated fair value of the restricted stock unit awards granted\\nunder the 2014 Stock Plan is determined based on the market price of Keysight common\\n73\\nTable of Contents\\nstock on the date of grant. RSUs generally vest, with some exceptions, at a rate of 25 percent per year over a period of four years from the date of grant.\\nPerformance share awards under the LTP Program, administered through the 2014 Stock Plan, are granted to the company\\'s executive officers and key\\nemployees. Participants in this program are entitled to receive unrestricted company shares after a three-year performance period, contingent upon the\\nachievement of metrics and targets set by the Compensation and Human Capital Committee at the beginning of the performance period. These metrics may\\ninclude total shareholder return (“TSR”), financial metrics like operating margin (“OM”), earnings per share (“EPS”), and others. For TSR-based awards the\\npeer group comparisons are set at the beginning of the performance period, while OM targets are set each year in the first quarter of the respective year. The\\nfinal payout under the LTP Program may range from zero to 200 percent of the target award based on actual performance. During fiscal year 2022, the\\nCompensation and Human Capital Committee approved performance retention awards with a target earnings per share (“EPS”) goal over a three-year\\nperformance period to select members of our leadership team. The performance targets are set each half year. The payout range of the award is zero or 100\\npercent, with no additional payout for performance above target.\\nThe Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) was adopted on July 16, 2014, and became effective on November 1, 2014. It was amended and restated\\neffective March 21, 2024. The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the plan is 25\\xa0million. The ESPP allows eligible\\nemployees to contribute up to 10 percent of their base compensation to purchase shares of Keysight common stock at 85 percent of the closing market price at\\nthe purchase date.\\nUnder our ESPP, employees purchased 562,455 shares for $64 million in 2024, 477,760 shares for $64 million in 2023 and 462,279 shares for $62 million\\nin 2022.

We determine fair\\nvalues for each of the reporting units using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach, or a combination of both. If multiple\\nvaluation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately. Valuations using the market approach are derived from metrics of publicly traded\\ncomparable companies. The selections of comparable businesses are based on the markets in which our reporting units operate, giving consideration to risk\\nprofiles, size, geography, and diversity of products and services. Under the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated\\nfuture cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of long-\\nterm future growth rates based on our most recent views of the long-term outlook for each business.\\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill for all our reporting units using a qualitative approach. Based on\\nthe results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than its respective carrying\\nvalue.\\nAs of October 31, 2024, we determined that no goodwill impairment exists and that the remaining goodwill is recoverable for all of our reporting units;\\nhowever, there can be no assurance that goodwill will not be impaired in future periods. Estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of\\nestimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results. It is possible that the judgments and estimates\\ndescribed above could change in future periods.\\nOther intangible assets with finite lives are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying\\namount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. No impairments of amortizable intangible\\nassets were recorded during the years ended October 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\\nThe authoritative accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the impairment\\ntesting guidance for goodwill.

When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be\\nrecorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market and assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or\\nliability.\\nFair Value Hierarchy\\nThe guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs used in valuation techniques into three levels. A financial instrument’s categorization\\nwithin the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. There are three levels of inputs that may\\nbe used to measure fair value:\\nLevel\\xa01 — applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\\nLevel\\xa02 — applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level\\xa01 that are observable, either directly or\\nindirectly, for the asset or liability, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or\\nliabilities in less active markets, or other inputs that can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.\\nLevel\\xa03 — applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of\\nthe fair value of the assets or liabilities.\\n82\\nTable of Contents\\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of October\\xa031, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\\n\\xa0\\nOctober 31,\\n2024\\n2023\\n\\xa0\\nTotal\\nLevel 1\\nLevel\\xa02\\nLevel\\xa03\\nOther\\nTotal\\nLevel 1\\nLevel\\xa02\\nLevel\\xa03\\nOther\\n\\xa0\\n(in\\xa0millions)\\nAssets:\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nShort-term\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nCash equivalents\\nMoney market funds\\n$\\n1,141\\xa0\\n$\\n1,141\\xa0\\n$\\n—\\xa0\\n$\\n—\\xa0\\n$\\n—\\xa0\\n$\\n1,934\\xa0\\n$\\n1,934\\xa0\\n$\\n—\\xa0\\n$\\n—\\xa0\\n$\\n—\\xa0\\nDerivative instruments (foreign\\nexchange contracts)\\n38\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n38\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n18\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n18\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\nLong-term\\nEquity investments\\n80\\xa0\\n80\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n56\\xa0\\n56\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\nInvestments - other\\n29\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n29\\xa0\\n25\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n25\\xa0\\nTotal assets measured at fair value\\n$\\n1,288\\xa0\\n$\\n1,221\\xa0\\n$\\n38\\xa0\\n$\\n—\\xa0\\n$\\n29\\xa0\\n$\\n2,033\\xa0\\n$\\n1,990\\xa0\\n$\\n18\\xa0\\n$\\n—\\xa0\\n$\\n25\\xa0\\nLiabilities:\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\nShort-term\\nDerivative instruments (foreign\\nexchange contracts)\\n$\\n6\\xa0\\n$\\n—\\xa0\\n$\\n6\\xa0\\n$\\n—\\xa0\\n$\\n—\\xa0\\n$\\n54\\xa0\\n$\\n'),\n",

Outside of the U.S., our\\ntarget asset allocation is from 11 to 70 percent\\xa0equities, from 30 to 54 percent fixed income investments, and from zero to 47 percent insurance contracts and\\ncash. All plans’ assets are broadly diversified. Due to fluctuations in capital markets, our actual allocation of plan assets as of October\\xa031, 2024 may differ from\\nthe target allocation. Our policy is to periodically bring the actual allocation in line with the target allocation.\\nEquity securities include'),\n",

Fixed income securities\\ninclude a portfolio of corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, government securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities,\\nderivative instruments and other. Portions of the cash and cash equivalent, equity, and fixed income investments are held in commingled funds. Investments in\\ncommingled funds are valued using the net asset value (“NAV”) method as a practical expedient. Investments valued using the NAV method are allocated\\nacross a broad array of funds and diversify the portfolio. The value of the plan assets directly affects the funded status of our pension and post-retirement\\nbenefit plans recorded in the financial statements. In March 2021, we entered into an insurance buy-in contract for a portion of benefit obligations under the\\nU.K. defined benefit plan and classified it as “other investments.” In December 2021, we completed the second phase of the same contract. The insurance buy-\\nin contract is similar to an annuity contract, which matches cash flows with future benefit payments for a specific group of pensioners with the obligation\\nremaining with the plan. This contract is issued by a third-party insurance company with no affiliation to us. The insurance contract is valued on an insurer\\npricing basis, which reflects the purchase price adjusted for changes in discount rates and other actuarial assumptions, which approximates fair value.\\nFair Value.\\xa0The measurement of the fair value of pension and post-retirement plan assets uses the valuation methodologies and the inputs as described in\\nNote\\xa08, “Fair Value Measurements.”\\nCash and Cash Equivalents\\xa0- Cash and cash equivalents consist of short-term investment funds that are invested in short-term domestic fixed income\\nsecurities and other securities with debt-like characteristics, emphasizing short-term maturities and quality. Cash and cash equivalents are generally classified\\nas Level\\xa02 investments except when the cash and cash equivalents are held in commingled funds, which have a daily NAV derived from quoted prices for the\\nunderlying securities in active markets; these are classified as assets measured at NAV.\\nEquity\\xa0- Some equity securities consisting of common and preferred stock are held in commingled funds, which have daily NAVs derived from quoted\\nprices for the underlying securities in active markets; these are classified as assets measured at NAV. Commingled funds that have quoted prices in active\\nmarkets are classified as Level 1 investments. Equity also includes some growth-seeking real estate commingled funds that are measured at NAV.\\nFixed Income\\xa0 - Some fixed income securities are held in commingled funds that have daily NAVs derived from the underlying securities; these are\\nclassified as assets measured at NAV. Commingled funds that have quoted prices in active markets are classified as Level 1 investments. Some fixed income\\nsecurities that are not actively traded and are valued basis inputs, such as quoted price of similar securities, or other inputs that can be derived principally from\\nor corroborated by observable market data are classified as Level 2 investments.\\nOther Investments - Other investments represents the U.K. insurance buy-in contract and is classified as a Level 3 investment.

The expected long-term return on assets below represents an estimate of long-term returns on investment\\nportfolios, consisting of a mixture of equities, fixed income and other investments, in proportion to the asset allocations of each of our plans. We consider long-\\nterm rates of return, which are weighted based on the asset classes (both historical and forecasted) in which we expect our pension and post-retirement\\n96\\nTable of Contents\\nfunds to be invested. Discount rates reflect the current rate at which pension and post-retirement obligations could be settled based on the measurement dates of\\nthe plans, which is October\\xa031. The U.S. discount rates as of October 31, 2024 and 2023 were determined based on the results of matching expected plan\\nbenefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. The Non-U.S. discount rates as of October\\xa0 31, 2024 and 2023 were\\ndetermined based on a granular approach, which discounts the expected plan benefit payments with rates from a high-quality corporate bond yield curve. In\\naddition, we used this method to calculate two components of the periodic benefit cost: service cost and interest cost. The range of assumptions that were used\\nfor the Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Plans reflects the different economic environments within various countries.\\nAssumptions used to calculate the net periodic benefit cost (benefit) were as follows:\\nYear Ended October 31,\\n2024\\n2023\\nU.S. Defined Benefit Plans:\\n\\xa0\\nDiscount rate\\n6.50%\\n6.00%\\nAverage increase in compensation levels\\n3.50%\\n3.50%\\nExpected long-term return on assets\\n8.00%\\n8.00%\\nNon-U.S. Defined Benefit Plans:\\n\\xa0\\nDiscount rate\\n2.50-5.35%\\n1.87-4.22%\\nAverage increase in compensation levels\\n2.50-3.00%\\n2.50-3.00%\\nExpected long-term return on assets\\n4.73-7.00%\\n4.16-7.00%\\nU.S. Post-Retirement Benefits Plan:\\n\\xa0\\nDiscount rate\\n6.50%\\n6.00%\\nExpected long-term return on assets\\n8.00%\\n8.00%\\nCurrent medical cost trend rate\\n6.50%\\n7.00%\\nUltimate medical cost trend rate\\n4.75%\\n4.75%\\nMedical cost trend rate decreases to ultimate rate in year\\n2029\\n2029\\nAssumptions used to calculate the benefit obligation as of October 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\\nYear Ended'),\n",

On January 1, 2022, Centripetal Networks filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in Virginia, alleging that certain\\nKeysight products infringe certain of Centripetal’s patents. In addition, in February 2022 Centripetal filed complaints in Germany alleging infringement of\\ncertain of Centripetal’s German patents, and in April 2022 Centripetal filed a complaint with the International Trade Commission (“ITC”) requesting that they\\ninvestigate whether Keysight violated Section 337 of the Tariff Act (“Section 337”) and should be enjoined from importing certain products that are\\nmanufactured outside of the U.S. and which are alleged to infringe Centripetal patents. On December 5, 2023, the ITC issued its Notice of Determination that\\nKeysight did not unfairly import products in violation of Section 337 and the investigation was terminated. Centripetal has appealed this determination. On\\nAugust 21, 2024, Keysight was served in Germany with a complaint filed in the Unified Patent Court alleging that certain Keysight products sold in Germany,\\nFrance, Italy and the Netherlands infringe a European Centripetal patent. We deny the allegations and are aggressively defending each case.\\nAlthough there are no matters pending that we currently believe are probable and reasonably possible of having a material impact to our business,\\nconsolidated financial position, or results of operations or cash flows, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and is difficult to predict. An adverse\\noutcome in any outstanding lawsuit or proceeding could result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief.

We have not historically made payments related to these obligations, and do not\\nbelieve that our indemnification obligations related to such claims were material as of October\\xa031, 2024.\\n100\\nTable of Contents\\nOther Indemnifications\\nAs is customary in our industry and as provided for in local law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, many of our standard contracts provide remedies to our\\ncustomers and others with whom we enter into contracts, such as defense, settlement, or payment of judgment for intellectual property claims related to the use\\nof our products. From time to time we indemnify customers, as well as our suppliers, contractors, lessors, lessees, companies that purchase our businesses or\\nassets and others with whom we enter into contracts, against combinations of loss, expense, or liability arising from various triggering events related to the sale\\nand the use of our products and services, the use of their goods and services, the use of facilities and state of our owned facilities, the state of the assets and\\nbusinesses that we sell and other matters covered by such contracts, usually up to a specified maximum amount. In addition, from time to time we also provide\\nprotection to these parties against claims related to undiscovered liabilities, additional product liability or environmental obligations. In our experience, claims\\nmade under such indemnifications are rare and we do not believe that our indemnification obligations related to such claims were material as of October\\xa031,\\n2024.\\n15.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\\nStock Repurchase Program\\nOn March 6, 2023, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $1,500\\xa0 million of the company’s\\ncommon stock, of which $485\\xa0million remained as of October 31, 2024.\\nUnder our stock repurchase program, shares may be purchased from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment\\nopportunities, through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or other means.

Segment\\noperating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to each segment and to assess\\nperformance. Other factors, including market separation and customer specific applications, go-to-market channels, products and services, and manufacturing\\nare considered in determining the formation of these operating segments.\\nDescriptions of our two reportable segments are as follows:\\nThe Communications Solutions Group (“CSG”) serves customers spanning the global commercial communications and aerospace, defense, and\\ngovernment end markets. The group’s solutions consist of electronic design and test software, instrumentation, systems, and related services. These solutions\\nare used in the simulation, design, validation, manufacturing,\\n102\\nTable of Contents\\ninstallation, and optimization of communication systems in wireless, wireline, enterprise, and aerospace, defense, and government end markets. In addition, the\\ngroup provides automated software test solutions to automatically identify, build, and execute tests critical to digital business success and a strong customer\\nexperience.\\nThe Electronic Industrial Solutions Group (“EISG”) serves customers across a diverse set of end markets focused on automotive and energy,\\nsemiconductor solutions, and general electronics. The group’s solutions consist of electronic design, test and simulation software, instrumentation, systems, and\\nrelated services. These solutions are used in the simulation, design, validation, manufacturing, installation, and optimization of electronic equipment. In\\naddition, the group provides automated software test solutions to automatically identify, build, and execute tests critical to digital business success and a strong\\ncustomer experience. Our recent acquisition of ESI Group expands our application layer portfolio with simulation capabilities in automotive and general\\nelectronics sectors.\\nA significant portion of the segments’ expenses arise from allocated corporate charges, as well as expenses related to our centralized sales force, and\\nservice, marketing and technology functions that we have historically provided to the segments in order to realize economies of scale and to efficiently use\\nresources. Corporate charges include legal, accounting, real estate, insurance services, information technology services, treasury and other corporate\\ninfrastructure expenses. Segment allocations are determined on a basis that we consider to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to,\\nor benefits received by, the segments. Newly acquired businesses are not allocated these charges until integrated into our shared services and corporate\\ninfrastructure.\\nThe following tables reflect the results of our reportable segments under our management reporting system. These results are not necessarily in conformity\\nwith GAAP. The performance of each segment is measured based on several metrics, including income from operations. These results are used, in part, by the\\nchief operating decision maker in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of the segments.\\nThe profitability of each of the segments is measured after excluding share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related balances,\\nacquisition and integration costs, restructuring costs, interest income, interest expense and other items as noted in the reconciliations below.\\nCSG\\nEISG\\nTotal\\n\\xa0\\n(in millions)\\nYear ended October 31, 2024:\\nTotal and segment revenue\\n$\\n3,420\\xa0\\n$\\n1,559\\xa0\\n$\\n4,979\\xa0\\nSegment income from operations\\n$\\n921\\xa0\\n$\\n357\\xa0\\n$\\n1,278\\xa0\\nDepreciation expense\\n$\\n85\\xa0\\n$\\n41\\xa0\\n$\\n126\\xa0\\nYear ended October 31, 2023:\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nTotal and segment revenue\\n$\\n3,685\\xa0\\n$\\n1,779\\xa0\\n$\\n5,464\\xa0\\nSegment income from operations\\n$\\n1,068\\xa0\\n$\\n581\\xa0\\n$\\n1,649\\xa0\\nDepreciation expense\\n$\\n81\\xa0\\n$\\n39\\xa0\\n$\\n120\\xa0\\nYear ended October 31, 2022:\\n\\xa0\\n'),\n",

Stephens\\n115\\nExhibit\\xa019.1\\nKeysight Technologies, Inc. Insider Trading Policy\\n(Last reviewed November 20, 2024)\\nGeneral Prohibition on Trading While in Possession of Material Non-Public Information\\nIf you possess information about Keysight that is both material and non-public, you are subject to trading restrictions. You cannot legally trade in (which\\nincludes buying, selling or gifting) Keysight securities, disclose such information to anyone, including your family, friends and colleagues, who may buy or sell\\nsecurities because of the information (referred to as “tipping”), or make recommendations to anyone about trading in Keysight securities, until a reasonable\\ntime, usually the second trading day after Keysight issues a press release or Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filing disclosing the material non-\\npublic information that you possess. In addition, if you become aware of material, non-public information regarding another company which has a relationship\\nwith Keysight (such as customers, suppliers, vendors or other companies) that you obtained by virtue of your position at Keysight, then, similarly, you are\\nprohibited from trading in that company’s securities while you are aware of that information or engaging in any other action to take advantage of that\\ninformation, and you are prohibited from passing on the information to others to enable them to profit from it by trading in that company’s securities.\\nInformation is “material” if it would influence a reasonable person to buy or sell stock. Examples include undisclosed data reflecting orders, sales, earnings or\\nprofitability, or trends in these figures; impending announcements of major new products; significant cybersecurity incidents; major Keysight acquisitions,\\nequity investments or divestitures; pending public offerings or private sales of debt/equity securities; senior management changes; and important developments\\nin projects, alliances or litigation.\\nInformation is “non-public” if it hasn’t been the subject of a Keysight press release or SEC filing disclosing such information, or has otherwise not been widely\\ndisseminated to the public.\\nPersons Covered\\nThis Policy applies to all of our directors, officers, employees as well as designated contractors, temporary workers or other individuals working on behalf of\\nKeysight or its'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'chunk': 113}, page_content=' subsidiaries. The same restrictions that apply to you also apply to your family members who live in your household or are your dependents. In\\naddition, this Policy applies to all corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies, trusts and other entities that are controlled by you or your family\\nmembers who live in your household or are your dependents. You are responsible for making sure that any trading in securities covered by this Policy by any of\\nthese persons complies with this Policy.\\nTrading Window Restrictions\\nIn addition to the general restriction described above, directors, officers and other Keysight employees who have access to interim financial information are\\nprohibited from trading when the earnings trading window is closed. You will be notified by the Corporate Secretary or Assistant Secretary if you are\\nconsidered a Restricted Person under this policy. The earnings trading window generally opens the second trading day after the public announcement of\\nearnings and ends on the last trading day of the second month of Keysight’s fiscal quarter.\\nHowever, please note that the dates for earnings releases may change on very short notice. In addition, the trading window may be shortened or eliminated\\nunder certain circumstances, of which any affected persons would be notified. Please feel free to check with Keysight’s Corporate Secretary or Assistant\\nSecretary to make sure the earnings trading window is open.\\nIn certain cases, the Corporate Secretary or Assistant Secretary may notify specific individuals about special black-out periods that relate to events such as\\npotential major Keysight acquisitions. Those individuals may not trade in Keysight securities during the special black-out period even if it coincides with an\\nopen trading window. Keysight will not announce special black-out periods to the company as a whole, and if you are notified or become aware of one you\\nshould not share that fact with others.\\nWhat Constitutes Trading in Keysight Securities\\nFor purposes of this Policy, references to “trade” or “trading” in Keysight securities includes buying or selling Keysight shares in the open market; selling\\nshares that were purchased under the Keysight employee stock purchase plan or issued upon exercise of a Keysight employee stock option; and transferring\\nfunds to or from a Keysight stock fund account in a Keysight U.S. 401(k) plan. It also includes, among other things, gifts of Keysight securities, as well as\\nother direct or indirect transfers of Keysight securities.\\nProhibited trading does not include purchases of Keysight stock through the Keysight employee stock purchase plan or purchases, without sale, of shares\\nthrough exercise of a Keysight stock option. Additionally, prohibited trading does not include transfers by will or the laws of descent or distribution and,\\nprovided that prior written notice is provided to the Corporate\\n1\\nSecretary or Assistant Secretary, distributions or transfers (such as certain tax planning or estate planning transfers) that effect only a change in the form of\\nbeneficial interest without changing the pecuniary interest of the person in Keysight securities.\\nWritten Trading Plans and Limit Orders\\nThe foregoing restrictions on trading, including the earnings trading window restrictions, do not apply to transactions which are executed pursuant to the terms\\nof a qualified Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. To qualify as a 10b5-1 trading plan for purposes of this Policy, the plan must be pre-cleared by the Corporate Secretary\\nor Assistant Secretary and entered into when the earnings trading window is open and when the employee is not aware of any material non-public information\\nand otherwise comply with the requirements and procedures set forth in Appendix A hereto. It is the Company’s general policy to clear the use of Rule 10b5-1\\ntrading plans by those employees who are subject to the earnings trading window restrictions, or who otherwise as a result of their position with the Company,\\nare regularly in possession of material inside information.\\nThere is no exception from the restrictions on insider trading and trading window restrictions for trades made under outstanding limit orders. Therefore, you'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'chunk': 114}, page_content='\\nmay not have standing orders open for more than 5 business days at a time and must cancel any automatic orders during periods when you are subject to any\\ninsider trading restrictions.\\nRestrictions on Hedging and Other Transactions\\nKeysight policy prohibits directors, officers and other employees, as well as designated contractors, temporary workers or other individuals working on behalf\\nof Keysight or its subsidiaries, from engaging in hedging transactions, such as purchasing or writing derivative securities including puts and calls and entering\\ninto collars, forward sale contracts, short sales or short positions, with respect to Keysight securities. Also, Keysight policy restricts directors and executive\\nofficers from buying Keysight stock on margin or pledging owned Keysight shares as collateral for loans or other indebtedness.\\nPenalties for Insider Trading Violations\\nIf you violate insider trading laws, both you and Keysight may be subject to severe criminal penalties. You may also be liable for trading by your spouse,\\nfamily members or others who trade on material non-public information disclosed by you. U.S. insider trading laws apply to all Keysight employees at any\\nlevel, not merely to officers or managers. They apply to Keysight employees outside the U.S. who trade within the U.S. They apply even to relatively small\\ntransactions.\\nSimilar laws in other countries may apply to trading by Keysight employees who are located in those countries, or to trades in exchanges that are located there.\\nMost of Europe is covered by insider trading restrictions under an EU directive and parallel national legislation.\\nSeparate and apart from any criminal penalties, employees who violate Keysight’s insider trading policies are subject to disciplinary action, which may include\\ntermination of employment, whether or not their failure to comply results in a violation of law. Keysight reserves the right to determine, in its own discretion\\nand on the basis of information available to it, whether this Policy has been violated. It is not necessary for Keysight to await the filing or conclusion of a civil\\nor criminal action against the alleged violator before taking disciplinary action.\\nTransactions by Keysight\\nKeysight will not engage in trading in Keysight securities, except in compliance with applicable securities laws.\\nReporting Violations\\nAny director, officer or employee who violates this Policy or any applicable insider trading laws, or who knows of any violation by any other director, officer\\nor employee, must report the violation immediately to the Corporate Secretary or Assistant Secretary. You may also contact Keysight’s Compliance Hotline\\nusing the information described at https://secure.ethicspoint.com/domain/media/en/gui/62494/index.html. Upon learning of a potential violation, the Corporate\\nSecretary or Assistant Secretary, in consultation with the Company’s outside legal counsel, will determine whether Keysight should release any material non-\\npublic information, report the violation to the SEC or other appropriate governmental authority or take any other appropriate steps.\\n2\\nAppendix A\\n10b5-1 Plan Requirements\\nPersons covered by this Policy are permitted to effect transactions in Keysight securities pursuant to pre-cleared 10b5-1 trading plans. In order to qualify as a\\npre-cleared “10b5-1 trading plan” for purposes of this Policy, the plan must meet all of the following requirements:\\n1. The 10b5-1 trading plan must be established in writing, signed and dated by the person establishing the plan and pre-cleared and, if applicable, certified by\\nthe Company, in each case prior to entry, with an executed copy submitted to Corporate Secretary or Assistant Secretary.\\n2. The 10b5-1 trading plan must be in a form that meets the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the\\n“Exchange Act”), and include certifications by the person entering into the plan that (i) such person is not aware of material non-public information at the time\\nthe plan is adopted;'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'chunk': 115}, page_content=' and (ii) such person has adopted the plan in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade the prohibitions of Rule 10b-5 under the\\nExchange Act.\\n3. Each person establishing a 10b5-1 trading plan will operate the plan in good faith at all times during which it remains outstanding.\\n4. A 10b5-1 trading plan may not be established during a time when a trading window restriction is in place (i.e., the earnings trading window is not open or a\\nspecial black-out period applies) with respect to the person establishing the plan.\\n5. For any 10b5-1 trading plan adopted by any “officer,” “director” (as defined under Rule 10b5-1), or employee, trading under the plan may not commence\\nuntil the later of 90 days following the adoption of the plan, or 2 business days following the filing of Keysight’s form 10-Q or 10-K for the fiscal quarter in\\nwhich the plan was adopted, provided that the maximum cooling-off period is 120 days.\\n6. Except as provided below, persons subject to this Policy may not have more than one operative 10b5-1 trading plan at a time. Multiple plans are permitted in\\nthe following cases, subject to compliance with the requirements above and Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act:\\n–\\nEntry into a series of separate plans with separate brokers to execute trades, provided all meet the conditions of 10b5-1.\\n–\\nEntry into two separate plans with the same broker, provided that trades under the earlier adopted plan are complete before trades begin under the later\\nadopted plan.\\n–\\nEntry into a plan to cover withholding obligations related to vesting of equity awards.\\n7.

As part of this commitment, on November 15, 2023, the Company adopted this\\nCompensation Recovery Policy (the “Policy”). This Policy is designed to comply with Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the\\n”Exchange Act”) and explains when the Company will be required or authorized, as applicable, to seek recovery of Incentive Compensation awarded or paid to\\na Covered Person. Please refer to Exhibit A attached hereto (the “Definitions Exhibit”) for the definitions of capitalized terms used throughout this Policy.\\n2.\\nMiscalculation of Financial Reporting Measure Results\\nIn the event of a Restatement, the Company will seek to recover, reasonably promptly, all Recoverable Incentive Compensation from a Covered Person. Such\\nrecovery, in the case of a Restatement, will be made without regard to any individual knowledge or responsibility related to the Restatement. Notwithstanding\\nthe foregoing, if the Company is required to undertake a Restatement, the Company will not be required to recover the Recoverable Incentive Compensation if\\nthe Compensation and Human Capital Committee (the “Committee”) determines it Impracticable to do so, after exercising a normal due process review of all\\nthe relevant facts and circumstances.\\nIf such Recoverable Incentive Compensation was not awarded or paid on a formulaic basis, the Company will seek to recover the amount that the Committee\\ndetermines in good faith should be recouped.\\n3.\\nNon-Restatement Related Miscalculations\\nIn the event of a Non-Restatement Related Miscalculation, the Company may, at the direction of the Committee, seek recovery of all or a portion of the\\nRecoverable Incentive Compensation awarded or paid to the Covered Person for the Applicable Period in which the violation occurred. In addition, the\\nCompany may, at the direction of the Committee, conclude that any unpaid or unvested Incentive Compensation has not been earned and must be forfeited.\\n4.\\nOther Actions\\nThe Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion, the timing and method for promptly recouping Recoverable Incentive Compensation hereunder. Methods\\nof recovery may include without'),\n",

The Committee will, subject to the provisions of this Policy and Rule 10D-1 of the Exchange\\nAct, and the Company’s applicable exchange listing standards, make such determinations and interpretations and take such actions in connection with this\\nPolicy as it deems necessary, appropriate or advisable. All determinations and interpretations made by the Committee will be final, binding and conclusive.\\n7.\\nOther Claims and Rights\\nThe remedies under this Policy are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any legal and equitable claims the Company or any of its affiliates may have or any actions\\nthat may be imposed by law enforcement agencies, regulators, administrative bodies, or other\\n1\\nauthorities. Further, the exercise by the Committee of any rights pursuant to this Policy will not impact any other rights that the Company or any of its affiliates\\nmay have with respect to any Covered Person subject to this Policy.\\n8.\\nAcknowledgement by Covered Persons; Condition to Eligibility for Incentive Compensation\\nThe Company will provide notice and seek acknowledgement of this Policy, in substantially the form included as Exhibit B attached hereto, from each Covered\\nPerson, provided that the failure to provide such notice or obtain such acknowledgement will have no impact on the applicability or enforceability of this\\nPolicy. After the Effective Date, the Company must be in receipt of a Covered Person's acknowledgement as a condition to such Covered Person’s eligibility to\\nreceive Incentive Compensation. All Incentive Compensation subject to this Policy will not be earned, even if already paid, until the Policy ceases to apply to\\nsuch Incentive Compensation and any other vesting conditions applicable to such Incentive Compensation are satisfied.\\n9.\\nAmendment; Termination\\nThe Board or the Committee may amend or terminate this Policy at any time.\\n10. Effectiveness\\nExcept as otherwise determined in writing by the Committee, this Policy will apply to any Incentive Compensation that, in the case of any Restatement, or any\\nNon-Restatement Related Miscalculation, is Received by a Covered Person on or after the Effective Date. Further, as of the Effective Date, this Policy amends\\nand supersedes in their entirety any prior Recovery of Incentive Compensation Policy and any recoupment provisions which appear in a Covered Person’s\\nequity award agreements or otherwise (the “Prior Policies”).
