      "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n",
      "Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n",
      "Our Company\n",
      "Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\n",
      "All references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries.\n",
      "Fiscal Year\n",
      "We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 were all 52-week years.\n",
      "Principles of Consolidation\n",
      "Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and\n",
      "transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n",
      "Use of Estimates\n",
      "The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\n",
      "amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue\n",
      "and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including\n",
      "those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories and product purchase commitments, income\n",
      "taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, property, plant, and equipment, and\n",
      "other contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.\n",
      "In February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the\n",
      "estimated useful life of most of our server, storage, and network equipment from three to four or five years, and our assembly and test equipment from five to\n",
      "seven years. The effect of this change for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 was a benefit of $33 million and $102 million for cost of revenue and operating\n",
      "expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135 million and net income of $114 million after tax, or $0.05 per both basic and\n",
      "diluted share.\n",
      "Revenue Recognition\n",
      "We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud services. We\n",
      "determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in\n",
      "the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is\n",
      "allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance\n",
      "obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\n",
      "Product Sales Revenue\n",
      "Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in\n",
      "exchange for those products. Certain products are sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support\n",
      "and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for\n",
      "returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.\n",
      "For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time\n",
      "revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates,\n",
      "we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to accurately reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.\n",
      "Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing\n",
      "development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our\n",
      "partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for such programs for\n",
      "potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\n",
      "55\n",
      "Table of Contents\n",
      "NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\n",
      "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n",
      "(Continued)\n",
      "License and Development Arrangements\n",
      "Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components. As a result, we recognize the\n",
      "revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services\n",
      "are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each\n",
      "project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.\n",
      "Software Licensing\n",
      "Our software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase either\n",
      "perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are\n",
      "frequently sold along with the right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades. Revenue from software\n",
      "licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. Software support revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or\n",
      "as services are performed.\n",
      "Cloud Services\n",
      "Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession of the software or hardware, are provided\n",
      "on a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage. Revenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the\n",
      "contract period. Revenue related to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs. Cloud services are typically sold on a standalone basis, but\n",
      "certain offerings may be sold with hardware and/or software and related support.\n",
      "Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\n",
      "Our contracts may contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately accounted for as a distinct performance\n",
      "obligation. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements\n",
      "indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract.\n",
      "We allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling\n",
      "price basis. The standalone selling price reflects the price we would charge for a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstances\n",
      "and to similar customers. When determining standalone selling price, we maximize the use of observable inputs.\n",
      "If a contract contains a single performance obligation, no allocation is required.\n",
      "Product Warranties\n",
      "We offer a limited warranty to end-users ranging from one to three years for products to repair or replace products for manufacturing defects or hardware\n",
      "component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited\n",
      "circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a\n",
      "loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\n",
      "Stock-based Compensation\n",
      "We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units,\n",
      "or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of\n",
      "grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense for RSUs\n",
      "and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs\n",
      "is recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP,\n",
      "using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is\n",
      "expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures semi-annually and\n",
      "revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience.\n",
      "Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs\n",
      "We currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and\n",
      "other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third\n",
      "parties, and other matters. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions\n",
      "56\n",
      "Table of Contents\n",
      "NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\n",
      "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n",
      "(Continued)\n",
      "or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments or judgments. If information becomes\n",
      "available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the\n",
      "loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be\n",
      "materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.\n",
      "Foreign Currency Remeasurement\n",
      "We use the U.S. dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars\n",
      "at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates.\n",
      "Revenue and expenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to non-monetary balance sheet\n",
      "amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings in our Consolidated\n",
      "Statements of Income and to date have not been significant.\n",
      "Income Taxes\n",
      "We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax\n",
      "jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary\n",
      "differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available\n",
      "evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\n",
      "Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of\n",
      "complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome,\n",
      "changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S., or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we\n",
      "recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be\n",
      "due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to\n",
      "recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.\n",
      "As of January 28, 2024, we had a valuation allowance of $1.6 billion related to capital loss carryforwards, and certain state and other deferred tax assets that\n",
      "management determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extent\n",
      "realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\n",
      "We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits\n",
      "of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\n",
      "Net Income Per Share\n",
      "Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is\n",
      "computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Any\n",
      "anti-dilutive effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share.\n",
      "Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\n",
      "We consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be\n",
      "cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We currently\n",
      "classify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\n",
      "We classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These available-for-sale\n",
      "debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component\n",
      "of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the sale of\n",

Additionally, we can avoid many of\\nthe significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations. While we may directly procure certain raw materials used in the\\nproduction of our products, such as memory, substrates, and a variety of components, our suppliers are responsible for procurement of most raw materials used\\nin the production of our products. As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, quality assurance, marketing, and customer support. In periods of\\ngrowth, we may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical lead times, pay premiums, or provide\\ndeposits to secure future supply and capacity and may need to continue to do so.\\nWe have expanded our supplier relationships to build redundancy and resilience in our operations to provide long-term manufacturing capacity aligned with\\ngrowing customer demand. Our supply chain is concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region. We utilize foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\\nCompany Limited, or TSMC, and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., or Samsung, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We purchase memory from Micron\\nTechnology, Inc., SK Hynix Inc., and Samsung. We utilize CoWoS technology for semiconductor packaging. We engage with independent subcontractors and\\ncontract manufacturers such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., Wistron Corporation, and Fabrinet to perform assembly, testing and packaging of our final\\nproducts.\\n8\\nTable of Contents\\nCompetition\\nThe market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. We believe that the\\nprincipal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software\\nsupport, conformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We believe that our ability to remain\\ncompetitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to\\ndeliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both existing\\ncompetitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by\\nour products.

While we have in the past entered and may in the future enter into long-\\nterm supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient\\n15\\nTable of Contents\\ncommitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change. These risks may increase as we shorten our\\nproduct development cycles, enter new lines of business, or integrate new suppliers or components into our supply chain, creating additional supply chain\\ncomplexity. Additionally, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for the finished products are not available\\nfrom third parties. This risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy. In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply\\nor capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on our orders may be extended. We have previously experienced and may continue to experience extended lead\\ntimes of more than 12 months. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity, which have increased our product costs and\\nmay continue to do so. If our existing suppliers are unable to scale their capabilities to meet our supply needs, we may require additional sources of capacity,\\nwhich may require additional deposits. We may not have the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declines.\\nMany additional factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products,\\nor otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue, including:\\n•\\nchanges in product development cycles and time to market;\\n•\\ncompeting technologies and competitor product releases and announcements;\\n•\\nchanges in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased end demand;\\n•\\nsudden or sustained government lockdowns or actions to control case spread of global or local health issues;\\n•\\nrapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\\n'),\n",

Entering fiscal year 2025, we are gathering customer demand indications across\\nseveral product transitions. We have demand visibility for our new data center products ramping later in fiscal year 2025. We have increased our supply and\\ncapacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. These increased purchase\\nvolumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk. We may continue to\\nenter into new supplier and capacity arrangements. Our purchase commitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of fiscal\\nyear 2024 were impacted by shortening lead times for certain components. Supply of Hopper architecture products is improving, and demand remains very\\nstrong. We expect our next-generation products to be supply-constrained based upon demand indications. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if\\nour inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\\nOur customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may change or may not be correct, as we have experienced in the past. Product transitions are\\ncomplex and can impact our revenue as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship\\nand support new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our Data Center,\\nProfessional Visualization, and Gaming products. We will have a broader and faster Data Center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI\\nopportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to long\\nmanufacturing lead times. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of\\nprior architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience\\nreduced demand for current generation architectures when customers anticipate\\n16\\nTable of Contents\\ntransitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future architecture transitions. If we are unable to\\nexecute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our financial results may be negatively impacted. The increasing frequency and complexity of\\nnewly introduced products may result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty or other\\ncosts or result in product delays. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has\\nimpacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we have managed prior product transitions and\\nhave previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our\\nsupply mix, and we may incur additional costs.\\nMany end customers often do not purchase directly from us but instead purchase indirectly through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, distributors, and\\nother channel partners.

If we cannot procure sufficient supply to meet demand\\nor otherwise fail to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market\\nshare and our reputation could be harmed. Additionally, since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability\\nissues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader revenue impact.\\nIf we overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may\\nnot be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a reduction in average selling prices, including\\ndue to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a result of our overestimation of future demand, and we may\\nneed to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our suppliers’ increase in prices, and we may need to\\ncontinue to do so for other products in the future. We have also written down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments and may\\nhave to do so in the future. These impacts were amplified by our placement of non-cancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms well in advance of our\\nhistorical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may\\ncontinue to increase as our purchase obligations and prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total\\nsupply. All of these factors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.\\nWe build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications, such as NVIDIA DGX Cloud services, NVIDIA AI Foundations,\\nOmniverse platform, LLMs, and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility\\nin our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. Recent technologies,\\nsuch as generative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for Data Center, the long-term trajectory is unknown. Because our\\nproducts may be used in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI\\nmodels on our reported revenue or forecasted demand. Additionally, we started shipping our CPU product offerings, the Grace CPU and Grace Hopper\\nSuperchips, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our ability to adequately predict our CPU demand may create volatility in our revenue or supply levels.\\nChallenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead times may occur if\\nwe experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan\\nand China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to\\nour supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us.\\nThe use of our GPUs other than that for which they were designed and marketed\"),\n",

Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new\\ncompute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards and changes in\\nthe method of verifying blockchain transactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further\\nimpact our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the Ethereum 2.0\\nmerge in 2022, have reduced and may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create increased\\naftermarket sales of our\\n17\\nTable of Contents\\nGPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs.

We also may face risks to our IP if our employees are hired by competitors. We continuously assess whether and where to seek\\nformal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if\\napproved, whether they will be enforceable.\\nWe are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations and other obligations. These areas could damage our\\nreputation, deter current and potential customers, affect our product design, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings and liability.\\nWe process sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, industry standards, external and\\ninternal'),\n",

Concerns about our practices or the ultimate\\nuse of our products and services with regard\\n28\\nTable of Contents\\nto the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, including for use in AI, even if unfounded, could\\ndamage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss or misuse of personal data in our possession or by one of our partners could\\nresult in damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased security costs and costs related to defending legal\\nclaims.\\nIn the United States, federal, state and local authorities have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including for data breach notification, personal\\ndata privacy and consumer protection. In the past few years, numerous U.S. states have enacted comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on\\ncovered businesses, including providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights concerning their personal data. As\\napplicable, such rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data, and to opt-out of certain data processing activities, such as\\ntargeted advertising, profiling and automated decision-making. The exercise of these rights may impact our business and ability to provide our products and\\nservices. Certain states also impose stricter requirements for processing certain personal data, including sensitive information, such as conducting data privacy\\nimpact assessments. These state laws allow for statutory fines for noncompliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended by\\nthe California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, or collectively the CCPA, gives California residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing\\nof their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared. The CCPA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per intentional\\nviolation and the law created a private right of action for certain data breaches. Similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal\\nand local levels. Additionally, several states and localities have enacted measures related to the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in products\\nand services. If we become subject to additional data privacy laws, the risk of enforcement action against us could increase.\\nWorldwide regulatory authorities are also considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection. The European Union adopted\\nthe General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom similarly adopted the U.K. GDPR, governing the strict handling of personal data of\\npersons within the European Economic Area, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively, including its use and protection and the ability of persons whose\\ndata is stored to access, correct, and delete such data about themselves. If we are found not to comply, we could be subject to penalties of up to €20 million or\\n4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and classes of individuals or consumer protection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing of\\ntheir personal data. Furthermore, the EU AI Act could impose onerous obligations that may disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and require us to\\nchange our business practices.\\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may transfer personal data from Europe, China, and other jurisdictions to the United States or other countries. Certain\\njurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data transfer laws. For example, the GDPR generally restricts the transfer of\\npersonal data to countries outside of the EEA. The European Commission released a set of “Standard Contractual Clauses” designed for entities to validly\\ntransfer personal data out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate level of protection, including the\\nUnited States. Additionally, the U.K.’s International Data Transfer Agreement / Addendum, as well'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'chunk': 37}, page_content=' as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the U.K.\\nextension thereto (which allows for transfers to relevant U.S.-based organizations who self-certify compliance and participate in the Framework) are mechanisms\\nthat may be used to transfer personal data from the EEA and U.K. to the United States. However, these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is\\nno assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to the United States. Other jurisdictions have enacted or are\\nconsidering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws and local personal data residency laws, any of which would increase the cost and complexity of\\ndoing business and could result in fines from regulators. For example, China’s law imposes various requirements relating to data processing and data\\nlocalization. Data broadly defined as important under China’s law, including personal data, may not be transferable outside of China without prior assessment\\nand approval by the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC. Compliance with these requirements, including CAC assessments and any deemed failures of\\nsuch assessments, could cause us to incur liability, prevent us from using data collected in China or impact our ability to transfer data outside of China. The\\ninability to import personal data to the United States could significantly and negatively impact our business operations, limit our ability to collaborate with parties\\nthat are subject to European, China and other data privacy and security laws, or require us to increase our personal data processing capabilities in Europe\\nand/or elsewhere at significant expense. Some European regulators have prevented companies from transferring personal data out of Europe for allegedly\\nviolating the GDPR’s cross-border data transfer limitations, which could negatively impact our business.\\nWe may also be bound by contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and our efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successful or\\nmay be claimed to be non-compliant. For example, certain privacy laws, such as the GDPR and the CCPA, require our customers to impose specific contractual\\nrestrictions on their service providers. We sometimes host personal data in collaboration with our customers, and if a breach exposed or altered that personal\\ndata, it could harm those customer relationships and subject us to litigation, regulatory action, or fines. We publish privacy policies, marketing materials and\\nother statements, such as compliance with certain certifications or self-regulatory principles, regarding data privacy and security. If these policies, materials or\\nstatements are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative of our practices, we may be subject to investigation,\\nenforcement actions by regulators or other adverse consequences.\\n29\\nTable of Contents\\nData protection laws around the world are quickly changing and may be interpreted and applied in an increasingly stringent fashion and in a manner that is\\ninconsistent with our data practices. These obligations may affect our product design and necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems and\\npractices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf. Despite our efforts, we or third parties we rely upon may fail to comply with\\nsuch obligations. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security obligations, we could face significant\\nconsequences, including but not limited to, government enforcement actions, litigation, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing\\npersonal data, and orders to destroy or not use personal data. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial\\ncondition.\\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, higher than expected\\ntax rates and other tax-related factors.\\nWe are subject to complex income tax laws and regulations, as well as non-income-based taxes, in various jurisdictions.

Although\\nwe believe our tax estimates are reasonable, any adverse outcome could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes\\nimposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, net income, and cash flows.\\nFurther, changes in tax laws or their interpretation by tax authorities in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions could increase our future tax liability or cause other\\nadverse tax impacts, which may materially impact our results of operations, or the way we conduct our business. Most of our income is taxable in the United\\nStates, with a significant portion qualifying for preferential treatment as foreign-derived intangible income, or FDII. If U.S. tax rates increase or the FDII deduction\\nis reduced, our provision for income taxes, results of operations, net income and cash flows would be adversely affected. In addition, changes in the tax laws of\\nforeign jurisdictions could arise as a result of global implementation of the Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting and Pillar Two Model Rules\\nannounced by The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD. These and other changes in the foreign tax laws, as adopted by\\ncountries, may increase tax uncertainty and adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations, and financial condition.\\nOur future effective tax rate may also be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business or statutory rates, the mix of earnings in countries\\nwith differing statutory tax rates, available tax incentives, credits and deductions, the expiration of statutes of limitations, changes in accounting principles,\\nadjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, the estimates of our deferred tax assets and\\nliabilities and deferred tax asset valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for business\\ncombinations, as well as changes in the domestic or international organization of our business and structure. Furthermore, the tax effects of accounting for\\nstock-based compensation and volatility in our stock price may significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period in which they occur. A decline in our stock\\nprice may result in reduced future tax benefits from stock-based compensation, increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results.\\nOur business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.\\nWe currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or investigations involving shareholder,\\nconsumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business. For example, we are defending a securities class action lawsuit from multiple shareholders\\nasserting claims that we and certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency\\nmining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary\\ndamages or fines, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other\\nremedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents.

Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have\\nexpanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for accelerated\\ncomputing, AI solutions, scientific computing, data science, AV, robotics, metaverse and 3D internet applications.\\nOur two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics.\" Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV,\\nItem 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\\nDemand and Supply, Product Transitions, and New Products and Business Models\\nDemand for our data center systems and products surged in fiscal year 2024. Entering fiscal year 2025, we are gathering customer demand indications across\\nseveral product transitions. We have demand visibility for our new data center products ramping later in fiscal year 2025. We have increased our supply and\\ncapacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. These increased purchase\\nvolumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk. Our purchase\\ncommitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of fiscal year 2024 were impacted by shortening lead times for certain\\ncomponents. We may continue to enter into new supplier and capacity arrangements. Supply of Hopper architecture products is improving, and demand remains\\nvery strong. We expect our next-generation products to be supply-constrained based upon demand indications. We may incur inventory provisions or\\nimpairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\\nWe build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have entered into long-term supply and capacity commitments,\\nwe may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change. These\\nrisks may increase as we shorten our product development cycles, enter new lines of business, or integrate new suppliers or components into our supply chain,\\ncreating additional supply chain complexity.\\nProduct transitions are complex as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship and\\nsupport new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our Data Center,\\nProfessional Visualization, and Gaming products. We will have a broader and faster Data Center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI\\nopportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to manufacturing\\nlead times. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures\\nahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. The increasing frequency and complexity of newly introduced products\\ncould result in quality or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty or other costs or result in product delays. Deployment of new\\nproducts to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing'),\n",

While we have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures\\nat the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs.\\nWe build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications such as our NVIDIA DGX Cloud services, Omniverse platform,\\nLLMs, and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or\\nsupply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. Recent technologies, such as\\ngenerative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for Data Center, the long-term trajectory is unknown.\\n34\\nTable of Contents\\nGlobal Trade\\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG, announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong\\nKong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\\nIn July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other\\nregions, including some countries in the Middle East.\\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to\\nChina and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our\\nproducts exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to\\nthe export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5,\\nincluding China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100,\\nH800, and L40S products. Our sales to China decreased as a percentage of total Data Center revenue from 19% in fiscal year 2023 to 14% in fiscal year 2024.\\nWe have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China. We are working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions,\\nincluding those for which the USG does not require a license or advance notice before each shipment. We have started to ship alternatives to the China market\\nin small volumes. China represented a mid-single digit percentage of our Data Center revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 due to USG licensing\\nrequirements and we expect China to be in a similar range in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the\\nlicensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the USG will grant such a license, or that the USG will act on the\\nlicense application in a timely manner or at all.\\nOur competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed in the long term, if there are further changes in\\nthe USG’s export controls. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the\\nexport control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our\\nbusiness and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement\\nproducts not subject to the licensing requirements'),\n",

In Data Center, we launched AI inference platforms that combine our\\nfull-stack inference software with NVIDIA Ada, NVIDIA Hopper and NVIDIA Grace Hopper processors optimized for generative AI, LLMs and other AI workloads.\\nWe introduced NVIDIA DGX Cloud and AI Foundations to help businesses create and operate custom large language models and generative AI models. As AV\\nalgorithms move to video transformers, and more cars are equipped with cameras, we expect NVIDIA’s automotive data center processing demand to grow\\nsignificantly. We estimate that in fiscal year 2024, approximately 40% of Data Center revenue was for AI inference. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, large\\ncloud providers represented more than half of our Data Center revenue, supporting both internal workloads and external customers. We announced NVIDIA\\nSpectrum-X, an accelerated networking platform for AI.\\nGaming revenue for fiscal year 2024 was $10.4 billion, up 15% from fiscal year 2023. In Gaming, we launched the GeForce RTX 4060 and 4070 GPUs based on\\nthe NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture.

The\\npreparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of\\nrevenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation\\nuncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of inventories,\\nrevenue recognition, and income taxes. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item '),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'chunk': 46}, page_content=\"15 of this Annual Report on Form\\n10-K for a summary of significant accounting policies.\\nInventories\\nWe charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and\\nfor excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels\\nand future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions, which requires management judgment.\\nSituations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory or excess product purchase commitments include changes in business and economic conditions,\\nchanges in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and\\ncustomer requirements, new product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand, failure to estimate customer\\ndemand properly, ordering in advance of historical lead-times, government regulations and the impact of changes in future demand, or increase in demand for\\ncompetitive products, including competitive actions. Cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory.\\nThe net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 2.7% in fiscal year 2024\\nand 7.5% in fiscal year 2023. Our inventory and capacity purchase commitments are based on forecasts of future customer demand. We account for our third-\\nparty manufacturers' lead times and constraints. Our manufacturing lead times can be and have been long, and in some cases, extended beyond twelve months\\nfor some products. We may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical lead times, pay premiums and\\nprovide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors,\\nnew product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.\\nRefer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and\\njudgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based,\\nin part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions where we\\noperate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our\\nestimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax\\nliability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements\\naccordingly.\\nAs of the end of fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we had a valuation allowance of $1.6\\xa0billion and $1.5\\xa0billion, respectively, related to capital loss carryforwards, and\\ncertain state and other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable\\nincome, including capital gains. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets\\nas income tax benefits during the period.\\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits\\nof the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\\n37\\nTable of Contents\\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenue Allowances\\nFor products sold with a right\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'chunk': 47}, page_content=' of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time\\nrevenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates,\\nwe may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return rights for certain stocking\\ndistributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of prior quarter shipments. For shipments to other customers, we do not allow\\nreturns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances.\\nWe account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, as a reduction in revenue and accrue for such programs based on\\nthe amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer programs include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specific\\nproducts and customer classes which require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program accruals\\ninclude a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and external factors.\\nLicense and Development Arrangements\\nRevenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services are performed. Each fiscal reporting\\nperiod, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project.\\nEstimated total cost for each project includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicable.\\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\\nOur contracts may contain more than one performance obligation. Judgement is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer\\ncontract is distinct. Except for License and Development Arrangements, NVIDIA products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a\\nsignificant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered distinct\\nand are not combined for revenue recognition purposes.\\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling\\nprice basis. In certain cases, we can establish standalone selling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable\\ncircumstances to similar customers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell a product or service separately, we\\ndetermine standalone selling price based on market data and other observable inputs.\\nChange in Accounting Estimate\\nIn February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the\\nestimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network equipment from three years to a range of four to five years, and assembly and test\\nequipment from five years to seven years. The estimated effect of this change for fiscal year 2024 was a benefit of $33\\xa0million and $102\\xa0million for cost of\\nrevenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135\\xa0million and net income of $114\\xa0million after tax, or\\n$0.05 per both basic and diluted share.\\nResults of Operations\\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 is presented below. A discussion\\nregarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on\\nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ended January\\xa029, 2023, filed with the SEC on February\\xa024, 2023, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at\\nhttp://www.sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com.\\n38\\nTable of Contents\\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in'),\n",

Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits\\nof controls must be considered relative to their costs.

Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,\\neffective internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued\\nby the COSO.\\nBasis for Opinions\\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for\\nits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial\\nReporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\\nStates) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules\\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable\\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial\\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,\\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and\\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control\\nover financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other\\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial\\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation\\nof financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in\\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'chunk': 57}, page_content=' regarding prevention or timely detection of\\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n48\\nTable of Contents\\nCritical Audit Matters\\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or\\nrequired to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and\\n(ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on\\nthe consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the\\ncritical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\\nValuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories and Excess Product Purchase Commitments\\nAs described in Notes 1, 10 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down inventory\\nfor excess or obsolete inventory and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of\\nproducts, based on the Company’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market\\nconditions. As of January 28, 2024, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $5.3 billion and the Company’s consolidated outstanding inventory\\npurchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations balance was $16.1 billion, of which a significant portion relates to inventory purchase obligations.\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the provisions for excess or\\nobsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing\\nprovisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, including developing assumptions related to future demand and\\nmarket conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assumptions\\nrelated to future demand and market conditions.\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial\\nstatements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess\\nproduct purchase commitments, including controls over management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These procedures also\\nincluded, among others, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase\\ncommitments; evaluating the appropriateness of management’s approach; testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and\\nevaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.

Fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 were all 52-week years.\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and\\ntransactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\\namounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue\\nand expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including\\nthose related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories and product purchase commitments, income\\ntaxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, property, plant, and equipment, and\\nother contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.\\nIn February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the\\nestimated useful life of most of our server, storage, and network equipment from three to four or five years, and our assembly and test equipment from five to\\nseven years. The effect of this change for the fiscal year ended January\\xa028, 2024 was a benefit of $33\\xa0million and $102\\xa0million for cost of revenue and operating\\nexpenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135\\xa0million and net income of $114\\xa0million after tax, or $0.05 per both basic and\\ndiluted share.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud services. We\\ndetermine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in\\nthe contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'chunk': 62}, page_content=' the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is\\nallocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance\\nobligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\\nProduct Sales Revenue\\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in\\nexchange for those products. Certain products are sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support\\nand extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for\\nreturns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.\\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time\\nrevenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates,\\nwe may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to accurately reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.\\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing\\ndevelopment funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our\\npartners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for such programs for\\npotential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\\n55\\nTable of Contents\\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\n(Continued)\\nLicense and Development Arrangements\\nOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP components. As a result, we recognize the\\nrevenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services\\nare performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each\\nproject. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.\\nSoftware Licensing\\nOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase either\\nperpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are\\nfrequently sold along with the right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades. Revenue from software\\nlicenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. Software support revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or\\nas services are performed.\\nCloud Services\\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession of the software or hardware, are provided\\non a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage. Revenue related to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the\\ncontract period. Revenue related to cloud services based on usage is recognized as usage occurs. Cloud services are typically sold on a standalone basis, but\\ncertain offerings may be sold with hardware and/or software and related support.\\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\\nOur contracts may contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately accounted for as a distinct performance\\nobligation. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a single contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements\\nindicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract.\\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations arrangement'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'chunk': 63}, page_content=' on a relative standalone selling\\nprice basis. The standalone selling price reflects the price we would charge for a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstances\\nand to similar customers. When determining standalone selling price, we maximize the use of observable inputs.\\nIf a contract contains a single performance obligation, no allocation is required.\\nProduct Warranties\\nWe offer a limited warranty to end-users ranging from one to three years for products to repair or replace products for manufacturing defects or hardware\\ncomponent failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited\\ncircumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a\\nloss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\\nStock-based Compensation\\nWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units,\\nor RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of\\ngrant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense for RSUs\\nand market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs\\nis recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP,\\nusing the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is\\nexpensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures semi-annually and\\nrevise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience.\\nLitigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs\\nWe currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and\\nother intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third\\nparties, and other matters. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions\\n56\\nTable of Contents\\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\n(Continued)\\nor other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments or judgments. If information becomes\\navailable that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the\\nloss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be\\nmaterially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.\\nForeign Currency Remeasurement\\nWe use the U.S. dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars\\nat end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates.\\nRevenue and expenses are remeasured at exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to non-monetary balance sheet\\namounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings in our Consolidated\\nStatements of Income and to date have not been significant.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'chunk': 64}, page_content=' in the current fiscal year by tax\\njurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary\\ndifferences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available\\nevidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of\\ncomplex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome,\\nchanges in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S., or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we\\nrecognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be\\ndue. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to\\nrecognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.\\nAs of January\\xa028, 2024, we had a valuation allowance of $1.6\\xa0billion related to capital loss carryforwards, and certain state and other deferred tax assets that\\nmanagement determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extent\\nrealization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits\\nof the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\\nNet Income Per Share\\nBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is\\ncomputed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Any\\nanti-dilutive effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share.\\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\\nWe consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be\\ncash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We currently\\nclassify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.\\nWe classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These available-for-sale\\ndebt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component\\nof shareholders’ equity, net of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the sale of\\nmarketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other income (expense), net, section of our Consolidated\\nStatements of Income.\\nAvailable-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. If the estimated fair value of available-for-sale debt securities is less than its\\namortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is\\nmore likely than not we will be required or\\n57\\nTable of Contents\\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\n(Continued)\\nwe intend to sell'),\n",

Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in the other income\\n(expense), net section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\\nThe carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short\\nmaturities as of January\\xa028, 2024 and January\\xa029, 2023. Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with\\nthe related unrealized gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. Fair value\\nof the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured\\nat fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For\\nderivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting\\nlosses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the\\ngains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when\\nthe hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in\\nearnings.\\nConcentration of Credit Risk\\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts\\nreceivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and\\nincludes certain limits on our portfolio duration. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and maintain an allowance for\\npotential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall\\nestimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit.\\nInventories\\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs consist\\nprimarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead\\nassociated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts. We\\ncharge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for\\nexcess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product\\npurchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates a\\nnew cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. We record a liability for noncancelable purchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in\\nexcess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of obsolete or excess inventory.\\nProperty and Equipment\\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method\\nbased on the estimated useful lives of the assets of three to seven years. Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and\\naccumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years.\\nDepreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under finance leases\\nare amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.\\nLeases'),\n",

Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months are included in operating lease\\nassets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our\\nright to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term.\\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using our incremental borrowing\\nrate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to\\nextend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.

The income and market\\nvaluation approaches consider factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and\\ncomparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic\\nfactors and the future profitability of our business.\\xa0\\nIntangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\\nIntangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under\\ntechnology licenses, patents, and acquired IP. We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from one to twenty years using a\\nmethod that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably\\ndetermined, using a straight-line amortization method.\\nLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in\\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and\\nused is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by\\nthe asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the\\namount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based\\non the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately\\npresented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no\\nlonger be depreciated.\\nBusiness Combination\\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, based on\\ntheir estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded\\nas goodwill.

These estimates are inherently uncertain and,\\ntherefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may\\nrecord adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the measurement period's conclusion or final\\ndetermination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated\\nStatements of Income.\\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.\\nInvestments in Non-Affiliated Entities\\nOur investment in non-affiliates consists of marketable equity securities, which are publicly traded, and non-marketable equity securities, which are investments\\nin privately held companies. Marketable equity securities have readily determinable fair values with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense),\\nnet. Non-marketable equity securities include investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value. The investments that do not have readily\\ndeterminable fair value are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly\\ntransactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer, or the measurement alternative. Fair value is based upon observable inputs in an inactive\\nmarket and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. All gains and losses on these investments,\\nrealized and unrealized, are recognized in other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\\nWe assess whether an impairment loss has occurred on our investments in non-marketable equity securities, accounted for under the measurement alternative\\nbased on quantitative and qualitative factors. If any impairment is identified for non-marketable equity securities, we write down the investment to its fair value\\nand record the corresponding charge through other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\\n59\\nTable of Contents\\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\n(Continued)\\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued a new accounting standard to provide for additional disclosures about significant\\nexpenses in operating segments.

The amended\\ncomplaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act,\\nand SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand\\nbetween May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the\\nExchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including\\nattorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA’s motion to\\ndismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from\\njudgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. On August 25, 2023, a majority of a three-judge Ninth Circuit panel\\naffirmed in part and reversed in part the district court’s dismissal of the case, with a third judge dissenting on the basis that the district court did not err in\\ndismissing the case. On November 15, 2023, the Ninth Circuit denied NVIDIA’s petition for rehearing en banc of the Ninth Circuit panel’s majority decision to\\nreverse in part the dismissal of the case, which NVIDIA had filed on October 10, 2023. On November 21, 2023, NVIDIA filed a motion with the Ninth Circuit for a\\nstay of the mandate pending NVIDIA’s petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Court’s\\n73\\nTable of Contents\\nNVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\n(Continued)\\nresolution of the matter.

It shall be binding and enforceable against\\nall Covered Officers and, to the extent required by the Compensation Recovery Rules, their beneficiaries, heirs, executors, administrators or other legal\\nrepresentatives.\\nThis Policy amends and restates the Prior Policy with respect to all Incentive Compensation that is Received by a Covered Officer on and after the Effective\\nDate. The Prior Policy shall continue to apply to Incentive Compensation Received by a Covered Officer prior to the Effective Date.\\nPolicy Statement | Responsibilities\\nIn the event of an Accounting Restatement, regardless of whether or when any restated financial statements are filed, the Company must reasonably promptly\\nrecover the full amount of the Recoverable Incentive Compensation, regardless of whether the Covered Officer engaged in any misconduct and regardless of\\nfault.\\nFor any compensation plans or programs involving Incentive Compensation, the amount of Recoverable Incentive Compensation shall include the amount\\ncontributed to any notional account based on Recoverable Incentive Compensation and any earnings to date on that notional amount. For any Incentive\\nCompensation that is based on stock price or TSR, where the amount of Recoverable Incentive Compensation is not subject to mathematical recalculation\\ndirectly from the information in an Accounting Restatement, the amount of Recoverable Incentive Compensation shall be based on a reasonable estimate of the\\neffect of the Accounting Restatement on the applicable stock price or TSR. The Company shall maintain documentation of the determination of that reasonable\\nestimate and provide it to Nasdaq in accordance with Rule 5608.\\nThe Company would not be required to recover Recoverable Incentive Compensation if (I) (A) the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this\\nPolicy would exceed the amount of the Recoverable Incentive Compensation, or (B) recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan,\\nunder which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of Code Sections 401(a)(13) or 411(a) and regulations\\nthereunder and (II) the Committee (or in the absence of a Committee, a majority of the independent members of the Board) determines that recovery would be\\nimpracticable. However, before concluding that it would be impracticable to recover any amount of Recoverable Incentive Compensation based on expense of\\nenforcement under (I)(A) of this paragraph'),\n",

The Committee may, but is not limited to, seek recovery from a Covered Officer\\nfrom any or a combination of the following sources, irrespective of whether the applicable source of compensation was approved, awarded, granted, payable or\\npaid to the Covered Officer prior to, on, or after the Effective Date: (i) direct repayment of Recoverable Incentive Compensation previously paid to the Covered\\nOfficer; (ii) cancelling or directing the return of prior cash or equity-based awards (whether vested or unvested and whether paid or unpaid); (iii) cancelling or\\noffsetting against any planned future cash or equity-based awards; (iv) forfeiture of any deferred compensation, subject to compliance with Code Section 409A;\\nand (v) any other method authorized by applicable\\nNVIDIA Corporation\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Application: Global\\nDocument Name: Compensation Recovery Policy - External\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPage 1 of 5\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCOMPENSATION RECOVERY POLICY\\nlaw or contract.
